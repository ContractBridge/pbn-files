{
It is fitting that these pairs meet in Match 1, for they are
at opposite ends of the experience scale insofar as the World
Top Pairs goes. Zia-Robson are the holders. That was Robson's
second Cap Gemini win, and Zia's fifth (with four different partners).
Zia is also one of only three players to have played in every
Cap Gemini. Not that Hallberg-Simpson are novices. Hallberg played
for his native Sweden in the 1983 Bermuda Bowl and they distinguished
themselves at last summer's Olympiad, but they are making their
first appearance here at The Hague.
The match started with a quiet partscore deal. Hallberg elected
not to open a Weak 2D although he had that option available.
He bid his suit second time around and bought the contract. The
defenders cashed their three club winners and busily switched
to hearts. With all suits dividing favorably, though, declarer
was always going to be able to set up his eighth trick in hearts.
N/S plus 90 and 2 IMPs to England. [Datum N/S 40]		{Marc Smith,

{
Robson could do no wrong on this deal. Both passing Zia's heavy
1NT response and rebidding 2D would lead to a making partscore.
Reasonably enough, Hallberg opened the SK against 1NT. Had he
found the testing S2 that we might have hoped for if Zia himself
had been sitting North, then we really would have discovered
whether the mercurial Pakistani was in form, since he would have
to put in the S8/9 in order to make his contract.
On the SK lead, Zia rose with the ace and promptly guessed diamonds
by running the seven at Trick Two. When Simpson won the second
round of diamonds, a club switch would have netted six tricks
for the defense, but Simpson wanted more. He switched to hearts,
hoping to find his partner with Q9xx and the CA. On winning his
second diamond trick, Simpson persevered with the HJ, but Zia
had both the ace and nine; eight tricks. N/S -120 and 1 IMP to

{
Robson's weak jump shift in competition worked well here, as
it prevented Simpson from supporting diamonds cheaply. Had Simpson
been able to make a gentle raise to 2D, then Hallberg might well
have pressed on to 3D (probably one down), which is the N/S par.
That's the short story. In the unabridged version E/W are pushed
to 3S, where they fall a trick short and N/S gain 5 IMPs.
There was nothing to the play in 2S. The defenders scored their
three hearts, one club and one spade, but there was no prospect
of a sixth defensive trick. N/S -110 and 1 IMP to Zia-Robson,
tying the match at 2-2. [Datum N/S -70]

{
Gabriel Chagas will love this deal, as he has long been an advocate
of allowing eight-level sacrifices. Indeed, with 8D costing only
1100, the objective for E/W would then be to buy the hand at
the six-level. As it was, no tactical moves were required. Whether
South would have fared better by bidding some large number of
diamonds at his first turn is doubtful. Likewise, total silence
from N/S would not have talked Zia-Robson out of this one either.
As grand slams go, this was quite an easy one to bid and there
was little to the play. Even so, it was not bid at three of the
eight tables, so N/S suffered a fairly random adverse swing.
N/S -2210 and 6 IMPs to Zia-Robson against a datum of -1960.
The best N/S result on this deal was achieved by the Belgians
against Auken/von Arnim, a sacrifice that cost only 200 points.
I'm sure we'll read about in the first Bulletin.

{
N/S have both a six-card and a seven-card suit, but by the time
each player had a turn to speak, his suit had already been claimed
by the opposition. Zia-Robson had a golden opportunity for a
huge pickup on this deal, as they managed to make East the declarer
in a diamond contract. Zia's 3C was a transfer to diamonds and
3H showed a red two-suiter with slam interest. However, Robson
was not sufficiently certain of the follow-ups after 3C to make
a confident strain decision in the end.
A pity, really, because his 5S was a beautiful bid, implying
(what he thought were) all the side aces, the SK and a useful
trump (hearts) holding. +920 would have brought in 12 IMPs. Hallberg
did not double 6H for fear that Robson might correct to 6NT,
although, as it happens, he has only 11 top tricks there and
little chance for a twelfth. 6H was two down: N/S plus 100 and
9 IMPs for England against a datum of N/S minus 300. Hallberg-Simpson
lead the match by 3 IMPs (11-8) at the midway point.

{
Hallberg's takeout double of Zia's 1D opening bid looks fairly
normal but it worked poorly for his side. Had North passed, Robson
would surely have responded, as is the modern style, with the
result that E/W would surely have gotten too high. As it went,
Zia could safely rebid 1NT in competition, showing a hand not
far short of 2NT opening strength.
The defenders attacked hearts and Zia won the third round with
the jack. A diamond to the ten and jack established the D9 as
declarer's seventh trick while he controlled both black suits.
N/S minus 90 meant 3 IMPs to Zia-Robson as the datum was N/S
plus 30. The match was all square at 11-11.

{
N/S can feel a little aggrieved here - after West's passed-hand
takeout double, the diamond finesse is surely odds on, but the
DK is, in fact, East's only honour. The defenders had chances
to let 4H make, but Robson thought enough of his high cards (rightly
on the auction: 2NT showed two places or no place to play) to
lead a trump rather than a costly spade or diamond. Zia's diamond
switch defeated the contract, Hallberg finessing and losing a
spade later. One down: N/S -100 was a flat board.
If North had been dealt the ten or nine of spades it would have
taken a second trump after the DK to defeat the contract (else
a partial elimination would see declarer home). Here it was not
necessary to defend perfectly. Unlucky for N/S, to be sure, but
still, they missed a chance for a big gain when Simpson (quite
sensibly) bid game in front of his partner. Stopping off to double
Zia in 3C would have netted the English pair 500 points and a
12-IMP gain.

Over Hallberg's strong notrump, Robson's 2C overcall showed both
majors, but he might have had quite a bit less. When Zia showed
preference (2D would have shown equal length) Robson blasted
into game. Zia had some scattered values, but not the right ones
- a minor suit ace would have been worth a trick, but the two
kings were not. Had Robson tried for game Zia might well have
accepted the invitation.
The defenders quickly took the first four tricks, although a
less active defense would not have garnered more. N/S plus 50:
2 IMPs to England when the datum was N/S -20. Hallberg-Simpson
reclaim the lead in the match, 13-11.

N/S simply got too high on this one, although on an average-plus
day the slam would have rolled home with trumps two-two or a
winning guess. Not today, though - you didn't think Zia would
have won five Cap Gemini tournaments if his opponents made all
their marginal slams against him, did you? Although the Hallberg-Simpson
convention card is silent as to the meaning of Hallberg's passed-hand
3D, their uncluttered style suggests that it was natural and
fit-showing.
Even so, both players stetched slightly and when that happens
the eventual contract is seldom cold. Hallberg-Simpson were the
only N/S pair to venture beyond game, so they paid the full price
of 11 IMPs against a datum of N/S plus 450. Zia-Robson lead the
match 22-13 with one deal remaining. There was one other glaring
exception to sully the neat row of 450s, and it was a big one:
Hampson/Greco scored plus 1080 against Weinstein/Garner. If my
midnight math serves, that's 4H redoubled plus one.

{
Our second-round match has last year's fifth place finishers,
Geoff Hampson and Eric Greco of the USA versus Sabine Auken and
Daniela Von Arnim of Germany, quite simply the best women's pair
in the world. Von Arnim's 2D showed five or more hearts and at
least game-invitational values. Auken's 3C was natural (possibly
canape), and normally would deny good heart support, but here
she wanted to show her club suit before the heart support, catering
to slam. Although West's 4H suggested slam, East's wasted DK
and lack of aces were minus features.
Hampson, North, with a difficult lead, chose the C4 (third from
an even number), which ran to declarer's eight. When the second
club wasn't ruffed, declarer only needed three-two hearts to
claim her contract. Two high hearts revealed the bad break, and
West played the CA, discarding a diamond (a spade would be no
better as South can ruff, cash the SA, and exit with his last
trump. When Greco ruffed the club and played a diamond, declarer
had to pitch, and was quickly down. Plus 50 for N/S, and 4 IMPs.	[Datum

Hampson couldn't open a weak 2D on the North hand even if he
had wanted to (they play Multi 2D). Greco's 1NT overcall wouldn't
be everyone's choice, but did have the allotted point-count and
prerequisite heart stopper. Both Auken's double (sound three-card
raise?) and Hampson's pass (forces a redouble?) were alerted
but von Arnim had opened light and escaped to 2C to say so. Greco's
unsolicited 2S and West's club raise were enough to convince
Hampson that his values were pulling extra weight, so he raised
to game.
West led the CK, and when East discouraged with the deuce, shifted
to the D3, jack, nine, and king. This was good defense and good
play by declarer, who continued the good work by cashing two
high spades before finessing the D10. Had the outstanding trump
been in West, declarer would have ruffed a diamond and crossed
to the SQ to make 4S. East ruffed, however, and cashed her two
aces for down one: minus 100 for N/S, and 3 IMPs to E/W. Only
Garozzo-Sementa against Chemla-Levy managed to bid and make game

Six of the eight tables scored plus 90 on the E/W cards, with
one plus 120. Unsurprisingly, Auken/von Arnim were the only E/W
pair to attempt a heart contract. This year's field does not
include many pairs using forcing notrump responses, so the mainstream
North American 2D rebid by East (leading to at least 3D) did
not feature here.
South's S3 lead solved one of declarer's problems. When the diamonds
proved to be three-two with split honors, declarer remained in
control and managed to accumulate eight tricks (three spades,
three hearts, one diamond, and one club). Minus 110 for N/S,

{
Greco-Hampson are fairly frisky with their Multi 2D (2-10 HCP
with either five, six, or seven-card major), but this one was
a classic textbook model. West's double showed a balanced hand
outside the normal notrump overcall range (either less or more
high-cards than a strong notrump). North had reason to believe
his "pass-or-correct" 2H would end the auction.
East led the D9 (second or fourth best) to West's ace. The lack
of wasted values in the diamond suit allowed declarer to take
ten tricks, losing only the three aces.  Plus 170 for N/S, and
no swing. The entire field missed this odds-on game when no one

Seven bids in a row without a pass usually means everyone thinks
highly of his hand. Greco, playing five-card majors, had to open
1C once he decided to open with  his three quick tricks, and
his raise to 2H showed a fourth trump (Support Doubles). West's
search for a spade fit was fruitless and the auction concluded
with South rejecting his partner's game try of 3C. Von Arnim
found the thoughtful lead of the DJ and Auken decided to encourage
rather than suggest a spade switch.
When she won the second diamond, West might have played a third
to try to protect her partner's trumps but she switched to the
C2 instead. Declarer won and ran the H10, certainly a better
percentage shot than a heart to the ace, trying to spear a singleton
honour. Declarer was in firm control now, and held his losses
to one spade, two diamonds, and one club: plus 140 for N/S, and
3 IMPs. Hampson and Greco had broken the 4-4 tie, and led 7-4
at the halfway mark    [Datum N/S plus 20]

{
In keeping with their style, North opened the marginal North
hand with 1C. South's 2D cue-bid was a limit raise or better
in clubs. As 2D had in principle denied a four-card major North's
first obligation was to show a stopper. Slam was never a factor
and South was soon to discover that game was no sure thing. The
D7 lead went to the nine, jack, and ace. Declarer was forced
into guessing the SQ for his contract now. Other leads would
have given declarer the time he needed to establish his ninth
trick.
Declarer did his best with a little subterfuge. He led the HJ
to the ace, and "passed" the CQ. East won the ace, and returned
the D10 to dummy's queen. Declarer had little to go on but lacked
the entries to play East for queen-fourth, and so played the
SK and ran the SJ to East's queen. Down two: minus 100 for N/S,
and 9 IMPs to E/W. Most of the room made game on this deal when
East was permitted to open the bidding and the SQ proved easier
to locate. Auken-Von Arnim had retaken the lead: 13 to 7 IMPs.		[Datum

South opened a 14+ to 17- HCP notrump, then accepted his partner's
game invitation. He liked his quick tricks, and the plethora
of tens influenced his decision to bid on. This led to a very
uncomfortable contract with the single spade stopper. The S10
lead collected the "one hundred honours," and declarer needed
both rounded suits to behave. The club layouts that work for
declarer included a singleton CQ in either hand, or queen doubleton
or tripleton in West.
With queen-eight-fourth of clubs (and no singleton or doubleton
HK onside) West can cover declarer's second club to block the
suit, and queen doubleton of clubs in East simply won't be guessed.
Declarer duly played the CA, and ran the C10 to East's blank
queen. The defense took four spades, two diamonds, and one club
for three down: minus 150 for N/S, and 2 IMPs to Auken/von Arnim.
A number of other pairs stayed out of game, and were minus 100

With reserves of extra strength, Greco decided to double first
and bid his suit later. The alternative -- 2D overcall, perhaps
with a double to follow - was not quite enough in the partnership
style (overcalls are limited to about 17 points). He followed
up with 3D over North's comfortable 2H, and Hampson resisted
the temptation to shoot out 3NT. Greco won the spade lead in
dummy with the king to lead a trump to the queen. He lost two
diamonds and two clubs when the heart finesse proved to be onside.
Plus 110 for N/S, and 1 IMP.
This board was fairly flat around the room, except at Zia's table,
where Zia-Robson collected a 300 penalty in spades from Garner-Weinstein

{
Not all of the Americans' weak two-bids are as solid as the one
we saw earlier. Here we see the frisky Multi 2D alluded to on
Board 14. West introduced her heart suit, and North's double
asked South to leave it in if he held hearts, or bid spades if
that was his suit. East's 4C was a fit-jump in support of hearts,
a nice description. When West signed off in 4H, North knew about
the massive spade fit, and bid a confident 4S.
Auken doubled 4S, perhaps reasoning that partner's vulnerable
4C bid gave E/W fair control in the side suits, but the N/S fit
was just too good. Three rounds of clubs scored the SK, but that
was all for the defense: ten tricks, and plus 590 for N/S. This
turned out to be only a 3-IMP gain for N/S as there were two
other 590s and an 800 in the same direction. Those defending
4S without doubling found that minus 420 brought them a 2-IMP
gain.		[Datum N/S plus 500]

East's 3S bid requested partner to bid 3NT with a spade stopper.
This bid is normally made with a long solid suit and at least
a stopper-and-a-half outside spades. While it's possible that
3NT could be the right contract opposite East's  0=8=1=4 distribution,
von Arnim was not intending to play there. She hoped that by
removing a putative 3NT to 4H she would suggest her slam potential
with a solid suit and excellent playing strength.
Greco had an easy 4S in this scenario, and von Arnim went on
to 5H, as she feared she might have to all along. Greco had enough
defense to double but declarer lost one diamond and one club
when no club ruff was available to N/S. Eleven tricks: minus
850 for N/S, and . . . no swing! Datum on the board was 850 as
seven out of the eight tables produced the same result. That
leaves the score at 15-11 IMPs for Auken-Von Arnim, 54-46 in
VP. A tough loss in the first round finds them in fourteenth
place, and Greco-Hampson are sixth.

Howard Weinstein and Steve Garner, who were on the American team
that won the Bronze medals at the Maastricht Olympiad, are playing
their first World Top Tournament. Tony Forrester and Geir Helgemo
have both won this tournament twice, but not together. Their
back-to-back wins in the Reisinger (1998-99) open their highlight
reel. Both pairs use standard methods. There are twelve tricks
available to N/S on the first board with a good view in the red
suits but 3NT is the normal contract.  
As it happens, two pairs played in 5C and Zia/Robson 6C, making.
Perhaps West bid diamonds and convinced North that his king-jack
were as good as ace-king. Here Weinstein didn't get the chance
to upgrade his hand, Forrester's weak jump overcall forcing a
decision on Garner (3NT vs 3S). Garner put up the jack on Helgemo's
diamond lead and tested the clubs. He could have taken twelve
tricks in a couple of ways but apparently claimed only ten: plus
630. As the datum was N/S plus 660. {Your host for this match,

North-South have the majority of the strength, and with flat
hands all around, 1NT is a normal contract. After Helgemo's low
spade lead, Garner would have had an easy route to eight tricks
if he had put up the king - perhaps the indicated play with a
switch to hearts looming. When he didn't, Forrester could have
returned a heart, after which Garner has to abandon clubs or
go down. On Forrester's actual spade return, Garner established
his clubs and Helgemo cashed his spade trick, Forrester discarding
the H3 after following low-jack in clubs. 
Those plays convinced Helgemo to switch to a diamond where a
heart would have held declarer to seven tricks) and Garner could
have taken the rest. Unfortunately, on the run of the clubs he
discarded a (diamond) winner instead of a loser from dummy and
so made only one overtrick. The table tennis exercise ended with
N/S scoring plus 120. The datum was N/S plus 110, so the board
was a "push."

{
Although North doesn't have much 4S is an excellent contract
for N/S and everyone bid it. Had Helgemo overcalled 2NT (minors)
he might have dissuaded his opponents from bidding game but 2C
(because of the disparity of the suits) left Weinstein an easy
raise. Forrester might have bid 4C or even 5C but his assessment
of his defensive prospects proved to be just right. 4S has good
chances even with the trump king fourth offside, but when diamonds
don't break and the HQ doesn't drop it would seem that declarer
can't quite get home. 
The contract was made three times, however, so perhaps West parted
with a couple of diamonds or led a low one early in the play.
There was little to the play at this table, although Forrester
actually gave Garner a "Grosvenor Gambit" chance to make it (by
not inserting the ten when a heart was from the entryless dummy).
Minus 100 for Garner. With the datum N/S plus 140, Helgemo-Forrester
won 6 IMPs to leadg 7-0.

When the opponents stop in a low-level "fit" partscore and you
have length in the unbid suits and a good hand in context the
case for protecting with a takeout double seems very strong.
Here, however, where Helgemo had the chance to act at a lower
and much safer level (after 1H-1S) and didn't, I think he deserved
the bad result he achieved on the board. Forrester had nowhere
to go and scrambled with 2NT, but Garner took the opportunity
to suggest a penalty and later followed through on his own. 
When the smoke had cleared, Helgemo had to declare 3D doubled.
Garner overtook the second spade in order to make sure of his
heart ruff, and when the defense reverted to spades, the stage
was set for a trump promotion. Helgemo did not enjoy the play
and finished three down: N/S plus 500. As the datum was plus

Forrester had a good hand for his intervention (2D showed spades

at a safe level. As is so often the case against low-level "fit"
contracts, a trump lead is best, and here that would have restricted
declarer to nine tricks.

Forrester to negotiate a tenth trick. Then, when Weinstein failed

With nine sure winners, 3NT is where you want to be, but it's
not so easy to get there, and with a possible flaw in clubs Weinstein
instead opted for 4H on the known six-two fit. On a club lead
Garner would have had to guess well to land his game, but as
Helgemo had been dealt a minor sequence in diamonds, he didn't
look any further. When Garner won the DA and ran five trumps,
Helgemo parted with a couple of diamonds (Forrester had played
his trumps upwards but it seems that Helgemo did not see any
the suit preference messages in these plays).
Now Garner didn't need to guess diamonds and could have made
an overtrick by leading the D8 from hand. He led the deuce instead,
however, so Forrester could switch to clubs while the diamonds
were blocked, holding Garner to ten tricks: plus 620. Remarkably,
no one went down in 4S, so unless West's lead of the DJ denied
a higher honour all the declarer's guessed the suit correctly
(the jack lead is more often from J109 than from KJ10) on their

Yes, Forrester could have been a little stronger for his game-forcing
jump to 2S, but Helgemo's decision to push towards slam with
all those jacks looks far too aggressive to me. If Forrester
had signed off with 4NT over 4C and Weinstein had led a diamond,
low, ten, jack, Helgemo has to lead a heart to the ten to make
it. Otherwise, down he goes. But Forrester didn't sign off; he
cue-bid 4H instead. When Helgemo cue-bid 4S Forrester didn't
care for his slam chances opposite a passed hand, took a chance,
and passed. 
Game in the four-two fit happened to be cold (just draw trumps),
but when Weinstein didn't return his singleton club at trick
two (which might well have tipped off Forrester to the winning
line) Forrester used dummy's trump ace for a first-round club
finesse and suffered a fatal club ruff: N/S plus 50. The datum
was N/S minus 450, so Garner-Weinstein gained 11 IMPs simply
for being in the right place at the right time. The Americans
took over the lead in the match, 20-10.

{
Garner's jump to 3S showed a good preemptive raise to 4H, usually
in the 7-10 HCP range, and even though Forrester and Helgemo
did what they could to push their opponents around, the good
6H was quickly reached (Weinstein's 5S, which would have to be
interpreted as a grand slam try, looks like an awfully big bid
in context, so perhaps there was some confusion over the nature
of 3S). On a diamond lead, it's on a finesse; otherwise, it's
cold. 
Forrester must have had some real hope of defeating the slam,
but his ace of clubs lead wasn't very challenging and Weinstein
would have taken the trump finesse in any case. Plus 1430 for
N/S. This time it would have been better for E/W to sacrifice
in 7C, down only 500 or 800 with normal play. The slam was bid
three times and no E/W pair bought the contract. The datum was
N/S plus 940 and Garner-Weinstein gained another 10 IMPs, extending
their lead to 30-10.

With three useful cards for his partner, Weinstein made the normal
decision to commit to game when Garner moved forward with 3H.
Even though he couldn't be sure of his side's having more than
seven trumps, he simply had too much to sign off and 3NT was
not a realistic option.
On the diamond lead Garner won and ran the HJ, led a heart to
his ten, drew trumps, and claimed eleven tricks: plus 650. With
the cards as they are a club lead and continuation would not
have helped the defense. The datum was plus 620, so another IMP
went to Garner-Weinstein, ahead 31-10 with one deal remaining.

{
Forrester's Multi 2D opening (usually a weak two in any major)
didn't do any real harm to his opponents, who reached 3NT without
apparent incident. Weinstein must have been concerned about losing
the first six tricks in hearts with 5D or even 6D cold, but it
was too complicated to bid 3S, which would be interpreted as
natural rather than stopper-showing. Besides, a good partner
provides a missing stopper when you need it, and Garner duly
obliged. 
With favorable lies in both major suits, twelve tricks were there
for the taking: plus 490. To defeat 6D East-West have to find
their heart ruff, and to defeat 6NT they have to lead a club.
With all the N/S pairs making a game, the datum was plus 470,
so it was another IMP to Garner-Weinstein, who won the match
32-10 (IMPs), 72-28 in Victory Points. The score that appears
in the Bulletin, however, is only 58-42, which suggests that
there might have been an appeal (our guess is Board 28, a score
adjustment to N/S plus 800 for 7C doubled would lead to the posted
VP total).

Our first match of the second evening features two pairs from
Western Europe. Wubbo de Boer and Bauke Muller were on the Dutch
team that won the Bermuda Bowl in 1993, and their Belgian opponents,
Zvi Engel and Guy van Middelem have represented their country
in international competition for more than thirty years. Engel's
ugly 2C (a likely minority action) actually made life easier
for de Boer, who otherwise would have had a difficult rebid.
Here he could double to show three spades, planning to bid again
over a minimum rebid by Muller.
When Muller took advantage of the cheap opportunity to show diamond
support and deny five spades de Boer gambled that his hand was
worth eight tricks and cue-bid 3C to inquire about a club stopper.
Thank you, partner. Dummy's ten of clubs was a big card, and
when diamonds behaved, Muller had ten easy tricks. Plus 430.
Only three pairs reached this game so the datum was N/S plus
230. Muller-de Boer gained 5 IMPs. {Your host for this match,
Anders Wirgren}

There are many times when a third-seat preempt at favourable
vulnerability will find fourth hand with a difficult collection
to describe, but here de Boer could do no wrong. A 4H cue-bid
might have given Muller some hope for slam but on the lie of
the cards 5S would be safe in any case. When de Boer contented
himself with 3S Muller had a normal raise to game. A straightforward
auction to the standard contract. 
Engel hoped van Middelem had a singleton heart and the ace of
clubs, but that was only a dream. With all his clubs high, de
Boer simply played SA, spade, claiming eleven tricks. Plus 650.

{
Would you rebid your spades or raise partner's heart suit on
the second round? That is a tricky problem, for sure, but Muller's
choice looks reasonable to me because of his good spade spots
and weak hearts. And when de Boer tried for slam with two cue-bids,
Muller simply blasted into slam. 6H is a decent contract, but
not so easy to play. Van Middelem's club lead appears to be a
good start for declarer, but in reality it is a good lead, attacking
the entries to dummy's spade suit.
De Boer tried to ruff three diamonds in dummy, but with the suit
splitting six-two, van Middelem could ruff in front of dummy,
later taking the setting trick with the HK. One down; minus 50.
he slam was bid three times and failed each time. As the datum
was N/S plus 280, the Belgians gained 8 IMPs to take the lead
8-3.

If you were to give the South hand as a first-round bidding problem
to a panel of experts, you would get votes for pass, 1NT, 2D
and 3D. Muller chose to show his heart stoppers with 1NT, later
offering jump preference to 3D. De Boer had an interesting hand,
but the knowledge of wasted heart values opposite turned him
off. 
With the DK and the CA onside and spades three-three, eleven
tricks are there after a trump lead if de Boer leads a spade
to dummy at trick two for a club down. When instead he gave up
a club and got a second trump play, he could take no more than
ten tricks. Making four: N/S plus 130. As game was bid and made
five times, the datum was N/S plus 440. A further 7 IMPs to Engel/van
Middelem, extending their lead to 15-5.

Had Engel known that his partner had two big cards for him (the

he would no doubt have bid more than 2D. My first reaction is
that van Middelem owed him a raise, but if you look back to Board
1 you can see why he did not. 
2D made ten tricks in comfort with the aid of a heart ruff in
dummy: N/S minus 130. Only Auken/von Arnim bid game with the

{
After Engel's forcing 2H reverse a raise to 3H by van Middelem
would have been forcing. He wanted to reach 3H without sounding
encouraging and deemed his hand too weak for 4H, so he bid 2NT
to suggest a weak hand, intending to follow up with a nonforcing
3H. It might have been important to rebid his spades but van
Middelem didn't want to create any ambiguity about the number
of hearts he held. When Engel showed a fifth heart, however,
van Middelem had enough to to raise. 
De Boer cashed two club tricks, but with the HK onside, declarer
had the rest: N/S minus 650. At six tables E/W played in 4H,
so the datum was N/S minus 650; no swing. There were two oddball
results that did not figure in the datum, however. One was obtained
by Garner/Weinstein at the expense of Hallberg/Simpson: 6H making
seven. Perhaps someone feigned a club void! At the other end
of the spectrum was the plus 250 achieved by Garozzo/Sementa
with the E/W cards against the defending champions. There will
surely be a story for us there.

A 1H opening in de Boer/Muller's system either shows five or

type was a live possibility, so Muller didn't take a preference
to 2C, passing instead. Engel protected with a double and got
his side to a fairly comfortable contract.

With six trumps and a singleton in an unbid suit, Engel wasn't
going to pass 3H, of course, even though he held only five HCP.
The contract depended on the location of the spade honors, but
after a diamond lead to the king and a spade back, it was natural
to play North for the ace. And that was that. N/S minus 420
If they do, however, they may find the profitable save in 5D,
which is only one down if declarer takes the correct view in
spades (low from North to the nine, later leading the queen from
South). Or, even better, they might push E/W to 5S. 4H was played

double was wrong (4NT was the winner). 4S goes two down if the
defense shifts to hearts in time, but van Middelem led the CA.
Although Engel played the ten to try to suggest a heart switch,
van Middelem (correctly cashed the DA and shifted to the H4.
De Boer won the ace and shed his heart losers on high clubs,
ruffed a heart and led a spade up. That was the moment of truth,
but van Middelem was wide awake. Engel needed more than the HK
to double 4S, so van Middelem knew where the ace was and played

North´s lead of the SQ with his ace to return a heart to the
jack, king, and ace. Declarer ruffed a spade high in dummy and

West started proceedings with a not-so-constructive 3C. North,
with a pretty good hand, doubled. East also had a decent hand,
and might have wished he could play this deal with North. As
it was, he raised clubs gently, perhaps hoping that the opponents
would  try for a contract of their own. Not so. Sacul was a bit
thin for a second double but who could resist? Karwur correctly
decided that this was the top spot for N/S (they can only make
nine tricks in diamonds). North cashed two high diamonds before
exiting with the SQ. 
Declarer played a club from dummy, ten, king (small might have
turned out better). He continued with SK, spade ruff, HK, HA
- curtain. South ruffed, and there was no way to escape another
trump trick and the heart loser. Two down: N/S plus 300, 7 IMPs
to Indonesia as the datum was N/S plus 30. If West had ducked
the first club South could not profitably return a diamond as
West gets rid of the heart loser. On a spade return East wins,
gives up another trump trick and squeezes North. The same happens
on a heart return (West must win with the king).

Robson's bold Landy (majors) 2C would not appeal to everyone,
but South simply bid 3NT, giving up on a penalty. North won the
spade lead and went for diamonds, leading small to the queen
and ducking on the way back. When East was forced to win the
doubleton ace he continued spades and now it was a question of
overtricks. 
East and West discarded enough hearts on the run of diamonds
to allow declarer to safely play a heart to the king, but West
had the ace and East still had the QJ. Nine tricks: N/S plus
600. No swing, with datum N/S plus 610. Karwur/Sacul still up
by 7.

{
When the first eight calls are all non-passes, normally at least
one player is overbidding. West's negative double showed four
spades and North redoubled to show a good hand. That gave Robson
a cheap opportunity to show extra length in clubs, which in turn
helped Zia to compete to 3C. Sacul, thinking all his values were
"golden," jumped to game.We have all been in worse contracts.
All we need here is a good lie of the trumps and the DK onside
(well, onside-third is perhaps necessary).
This was not one of those lucky days. South ducked the lead of
the CK, won the next with the ace. The diamond finesse did not
work. West returned a spade to the ace and the CJ was ruffed
and overruffed. East then ruffed the diamond return, and played
a spade to dummy´s king. Now South could, and did play the HQ
to pin West´s jack. Two down, N/S minus 100, giving Mahmood-Robson
their first IMP as datum was N/S minus 70. 7-1 to Karwur/Sacul.

After South gets support in spades it seems reasonable to bid
game, even if West´s heart overcall should be a warning that
suits are not splitting well, considering how bad West´s hearts
must be. However, Zia thought this was the time to look for brilliancy
(as he would say), and led a small heart. Karwur won with the
H8, played the S10, which was held the trick, then ruffed a heart
with the SQ. 
Another trump to West´s ace left declarer with ten tricks, the
defense coming to two diamond tricks. N/S plus 620 gave them
12 IMPs. The datum was a normal N/S minus 100. It seems that
any other lead would beat the contract. Indeed, N/S were minus
at every other table.

This deal is of the kind where you wish there was a Fast Forward
button to press in order to skip to the next hand. Hmm, we have
one, don't we. Here's the short story
North helped to speed up the play by leading the DK, then a diamond
to the ace. South played back the HJ, and when he did not ruff
the heart return, declarer claimed ten tricks: N/S minus 620,
no swing. Karwur-Sacul still leading 19-1. Inevitably, there
was one E/W casualty, Hampson/Greco scoring only 200 vs Muller/de
Boer. That looks more like 2/3S making five than something by
N/s down four not doubled.

Karwur's third-seat natural, limited 2C opening might have gotten
past a less ferocious competitor than Robson, but with "the perfect
hand" -- support for all four suits -- he could not resist protecting.
Mahmood thought he had enough strength to get home even if he
chose the wrong red suit, but that was not the case. At least
in theory. 
The defenders can take three club tricks and three diamond tricks,
mostly by ruffing. However, when North started with the CQ South
played the nine, perhaps to suggest a spade switch if North were
out of clubs. Had Zia played low on the spade, he might well
have gone two down, but he hopped up with the ace, drew trumps
(had they been four-two the defense would have taken the rest
of the tricks), and knocked out the DA. Eight tricks to E/W:
N/S minus 90. The datum was N/S plus 100 so the title defenders
gained 5 IMPs. They still trailed by 13, however, 6-19.

Mahmood must have been reluctant to respond 1NT to Robsons 1S
(years ago, before he converted to Standard American 2/1 game-forcing,
such heart suits would not be unbid). Over Robson´s 2S rebid,
he felt obliged to do something. As 3H would be long and weak,
his only option was to raise spades. Robson had lots of losers
and an easy pass. Karwur hoped he could shorten East's trumps
to create an extra trump trick for hmself so he led clubs, his
long suit.Robson won and played a heart, won by South who stuck
to his original idea, persisting with clubs.
 Winning with the ace Robson continued with a diamond to the
jack and South´s ace, ruffed South´s CQ, and played a trump,
which held. Discovering the bad trump distribution Robson entered
dummy with a heart and played a diamond toward his hand but Sacul
won and gave Karwur a diamond ruff. The ace of trumps was the
setting trick: N/S plus 50. Another IMP to N/S as the datum was
N/S plus 20. The running score was 20-6 in Karwur/Sacul´s favour.

West opened with 1D, his best suit. Over the 1NT response he
had to bid 2C, suggesting (but not promising) at least nine cards
in the minors. East, who had a surprisingly long diamond suit
for a non-supporter, jumped to 3D, where some might even have
bid game. 3H was the natural way to proceed but the auction soon
moved into slam mode before petering out at 5D.
Declarer took the lead of the SK with dummy´s ace and immediately
played a club to the king. South won the next club perforce with
the ace to continue spades. Declarer ruffed to draw trumps in
three rounds before ruffing a club. The position was far from
comfortable for Zia but when hearts broke three-three with the
queen onside there were no more tricks for the defense. Twelve
tricks to E/W: N/S minus 620. With the datum  N/S minus 530,

A nebulous 1D opening by Sacul did not stop Robson from overcalling
1NT. West asked for majors, then showed diamonds. Against 3NT
South led a heart, ten, jack, ace. Robson knocked out the SA
and finessed in diamonds and the defense could take only a spade,
a diamond and two hearts. The spade break gave declarer nine
tricks: N/S minus 600. It looks as if a club lead allows the
defense to get one or two club tricks, two hearts, the DQ and
the SA. 
But declarer prevails by ducking a club and endplaying North
to get three diamond tricks, losing only two hearts, a club and
a spade. Game was bid and made only four times and two E/W pairs
went minus. Hallberg/Simpson got 400 from Auken/von Arnim, which
was not quite the same as scoring 600 on offense, and Maas/Ramondt
colected an 800-point penalty from the Belgians. As the datum
was N/S minus 450, Mahmood/Robson gained 4 IMPs. They lost the
match, however,13-20, or 43-57 in VP. They remained in first
place but the Indonesians were now only 2 VP behind.

We welcome to our featured match, Alain Levy and Paul Chemla
of France, longtime mainstays of the fearsome French teams that
won both the Bermuda Bowl and two World Teams Olympiads in the
90s. Their opponents are Piotr Tuszynski and Krzysztof Jassem,
both members of the Polish team that finished a close second
to Italy at the Maastricht Olympiad. They are continuing the
pace they set at last year's Cap Gemini with a third-place position,
a mere 12 VPs off the lead. Tuszynski's natural 1D was limited
to 18 HCP, and the rest was natural.
Jassem allowed partner plenty of leeway with an invitational
2NT on his fast but empty hand, catering to a minimum twelve-count
opposite. East had an easy raise to 3NT, however, and North led
the S10. Declarer won the spade return, and took two losing diamond
finesses: nine tricks, and minus 400 for N/S. If South had found
the heart shift (either time he was in), declarer would have
lost at least two hearts, two diamonds, and a spade. First blood
to Poland: 6 IMPs. [Datum N/S minus 170] 3NT was made and defeated
four times. {Your match host, Drew Cannell}

A sound, natural French Standard auction to the top spot. Although
Chemla was minimum for his game-forcing 3D (with so many potential
losers) he avoided any pressure to catch up later. An alternative
to 3D might be 2NT, but Chemla didn't want to lose a potential
diamond fit. Levy had a very good hand in context but relied
on the inference that he would not have shown his spades with
a minimum hand including the three hearts he showed when he converted
3NT to 4H.
The C3 lead went to the king and ace. Declarer played a heart
to the queen, and had to lose two trump tricks, but had no further
problems when both the spades and diamonds were as friendly as
they could be. Eleven tricks, and plus 450 for N/S. It is no
surprise that eleven tricks were secured at every table around
the room and that no one contracted for twelve. The Poles continue
to lead 6-0 IMPs. [Datum N/S plus 450]

The normal contract is a high partscore in clubs, yielding ten
tricks. N/S figure to compete to 3H where they will fail, but
if North raises to 2H or 3H (preemptive) they might reach game
and get doubled. Indeed that is what transpired around the rooms
to generate a datum of N/S minus 220. Here Levy could have tried
3H but contented himself with 2H at the prevailing vulnerability
with a large number of losers. Tuszynski rejected the straightforward
3C in favour of a strange-looking value-showing responsive double
on the East cards ("usually two suits").
When Levy rejected Chemla's game invitation and Tuszynski showed
his true colour(s), Jassem converted to 4D, expecting to find
four diamonds across the way. Not lovely does not always mean
not successful, however. The H10 went to the jack and king and
as the auction seemed to place the CK in North's hand, Chemla
elected to clear trumps. Jassem soon claimed ten tricks: N/S
minus 130 for N/S. 3 IMPs to France. [Datum N/S minus 220]

with an extremely conservative 1S bid. There was no reason for
Chemla to carry on with 1NT, or a spade raise on his scattered
fourteen- count. Despite the combined 25 HCP, Levy was quite
content to be playing at a comfortable level: he could see that
it was going to be very difficult to find nine tricks in notrump.
Tuszynski could hardly be blamed for leading the DK on the auction,
and declarer took the ace. When he played a spade to the eight
in the middle game, he arrived at nine tricks (one spade, two
hearts, one heart ruff, two diamonds, and three clubs): plus

What should Jassem bid (if anything) on the West hand? There
are flaws to every action, including pass. The point-count is
approximately right for a 1NT overcall. The S10 has a little
cache, but the hand appears suit-oriented with the quick tricks.
Double lacks diamond tolerance, and both 1NT and double may lose
the fifth heart. Jassem considered 2H the "least-of-evils." Although
Chemla had the right shape to double for takeout, he felt that
his borderline hand, and partner's two passes dictated caution,
and picked up his bidding cards.
Jassem took the SJ with the ace, led a diamond to the queen,
ducked, and took a losing heart finesse. The defense gathered
in their black tricks, and eventually South was able to lead
a third diamond through declarer (North had shed a diamond on
the SK). Declarer's H10 held the trick, with North pitching a
club. Jassem went for his legitimate chance of making the contract
(felling the doubleton HJ). When South showed out, North's H6
had been promoted for the second down trick: plus 200 for N/S,
but 2 IMPs to Poland, back in frint, 8-6. [Datum N/S plus 280]

{
Levy's artificial 2NT inquiry uncovered a balanced four-trump
minimum (the French do not often raise with three trumps). Quite
certain that the 3S bid denied three aces, Levy settled the comfortable
game in spades. Although his slam hopes were dashed upon hearing
the negative continuation, this was a dangerous combination that
was much safer at the four-level than the "heartbreak" five-level.
Imagine how the play might go at the five level with four hearts
in East and three trumps in West. East led the C4 and Levy played
personalities by calling for the king.
Jassem won and returned the H2 to the king and ace. A second
heart went to the ten and queen and declarer could test trumps,
claiming when they broke two-two: eleven tricks, and plus 650
for N/S. No swing. Three of the eight tables actually took twelve
tricks when they received the D2 lead, and later ran the D10
to dispose of the club loser when the trumps broke. That shows
that the declarers were hungry in a dull set, on the lookout
for IMPs wherever they could find them. [Datum N/S plus 660]

{
Chemla's 2H opening was a standard weak-two bid showing six cards,
and 6-10 HCP. Levy's relay 2NT turned up nothing of interest,
but he carried on with 4H anyway. The excellent quality of the
heart suit makes 3NT a very good contract and here three rounds
of clubs would settle the matter in declarer's favour. However,
if West wins the club lead and shifts to a diamond, declarer
must win the ace or the defense has the time to switch to spades
and arrive at five tricks before declarer gets his nine. All
academic, however.
Jassem began with the CA and when Tuszynski gave count, found
the S4 shift, ducked to the jack. When the H8 came back, declarer
could draw trumps and  play a club towards the queen. This provided
a pitch for his spade loser, and he only needed the diamond finesse
to succeed for ten tricks. West took his CK, and ended the suspense
with the D3 shift. The DQ lost to the king for down one: minus
50 for N/S, and 1 IMP to Poland, ahead 9-7 IMPs in a hard-fought
contest. [Datum N/S minus 30]

{
Jassem's three-way 1C opening (12-14 HCP balanced, 12-22 HCP
natural, or 18-23 HCP any type) attracted a weak-jump overcall
2H from Levy. His suit quality balanced the seven-loser hand,
and gave him better odds that the opponents might not be able
to ascertain when to extract a penalty. In fact N/S do have seven
losers, and E/W had plus 500 if they wanted it. Tuszynski preferred
to double, showing, in their terms, a "flexible negative double
style." Jassem's 3H indicated the 18-23 range, and East showed
his spades.
West made a slam try in spades with a 4H cue bid, and RKCB located
two keycards with the trump queen. East's ace-fourth of hearts
had risen in value during the auction, and partner's 4H bid alleviated
any fear of two quick club losers. Why go after plus 500, when
plus 980 is available? Chemla played ace and a diamond in a valiant
attempt to defeat the slam - not today: twelve tricks, and minus
980 for N/S. I am happy to report that 6S making six was the
result at all eight tables. No swing. [Datum N/S minus 980]

East didn't like the idea of overcalling 2H on such a weak suit
and wanted to enter the auction so he hedged with an off-centre
takeout double, prepared to live with the consequences if Jassem
bid diamonds. South's 2S was a weak raise, and West's 2NT was
conventional (either minors or a lebensohl-style weak puppet
to 3C - the sequence is not on their card). When Levy tried for
game, Chemla was completely maximum for his bidding (useful fourth
trump, side king, and ruffing value).
Declarer lost only to the three aces when the SQ and DK proved
onside. Ten tricks, and plus 620 for N/S. This wound up being
2 IMPs to E/W, however, when three Easts decided that their three
aces were enough for a penalty double. They weren't, but E/W
paid only 3 IMPs for their enterprise. With one board remaining
in the match, the score was 11-7 IMPs for Poland. [Datum N/S

{
There was a time when most experts would double 1H for takeout
with the South hand, but those days are gone. The fifth spade
carries a lot of weight, and could easily get lost in a competitive
auction if the suit is not introduced early. Jassem's followed
sound policy when he refused to let his fourth trump convince
him to raise; although East was limited to 18 points there were
too many hands that could go overboard opposite any sign of life.
Over North's comfortable raise to 2S Tuszynski felt he had to
bid again although he had no convenient action.
When Chemla tried for game with 3D Levy made a return try with
3H but then subsided when Chemla could not bid game himself.
That was a well-controlled auction by the French to a reasonable
contract. The H9 lead began the tap, but declarer played with
care and had the time to garner nine tricks (five spades, two
diamonds, and two clubs): plus 140 for N/S, and 2 IMPs to France.
[Datum N/S plus 80] Time had run out with Poland holding on to
win 11-9, or 52-48 in VP. After two-fifths of the event, the
Poles held onto third-place, and trailed the leaders by 26 VPs.

{
Match 7 features two of the world's great players, Gabriel Chagas
of Brazil and Benito Garozzo of Italy playing with younger up-and-coming
partners, Diego Brenner and Antonio Sementa respectively. Garozzo
has won so many world titles that we've lost count and Chagas'
first world championship (of four) was won at Benito's expense
25 years ago, so we expect a keenly contested match. This deal
reveals a fiercely-fought partscore battle with all-natural bidding,
Brenner eventually declaring 2NT. Sementa led a normal, but not
very effective S5 to declarer's J.
Declarer won a diamond trick and turned his attention to clubs,
eventually picking them up for one loser. Sementa switched to
hearts when in with his club trick, but it was too late for the
defense. Brenner already had eight tricks, and the heart switch
gave an overtrick. While it looks as though West gave away two
tricks, the first with the opening lead, and the second with
the heart switch, declarer can always prevail by playing West
for the key cards, as the bidding indicates. NS plus 150 [datum
N/S plus 10]. 4 IMPs to Brazil. {Your host for Match 7, John
Carruthers}

{
A strong 1NT from Garozzo followed by a Stayman enquiry led to
the same 3NT contract played at every other table in the event.
Of note in the Italians' auction is the 2S rebid by Sementa,
which many experts play as merely checking back for a four-card
spade holding with Partner. This allows them to rebid 2NT with
no four- card major, a sequence made necessary when a direct
raise to 2NT is artificial, either a transfer, showing diamonds,
or a puppet to 3C, which could be a variety of hands.
With the CQ, H9 and DK favourably located for declarer, there
was not much to the play, Garozzo eventually emerging with nine
tricks in the form of three spades, two hearts, a diamond and
three clubs. Note the array of unpleasant choices Brenner faced
on opening lead against a contract that rated to be a close-run
thing. N/S minus 400 and plus 1 IMP, since five declarers made
an overtrick. [datum N/S minus 420]. 5-0 for Chagas/Brenner.

{
Another flat board in the bidding, if not the play. 4S was reached
at every table, here by a fairly normal route. Brenner led a
conservative H10, five, queen, ace. With potential losers in
every suit, Garozzo tried to sneak a diamond through before the
defense gained any further knowledge of the deal, but South was
too wide awake for him (it was still early in the day and the
event!) and rose with the ace to play a heart to Chagas' king.
Now, as long as North did not play diamonds, Garozzo was going
down, and Chagas made no mistake, getting off play with a trump.
Declarer still had a trick to lose in each black suit for one
down. Had Brenner not found the heart lead, he might have had
to guess whether to take the first or second (putative) diamond
to keep declarer out of the dummy. As it was, his path was clear,
and NS gained 10 IMPs since five declarers were allowed to make
their game, perhaps on a different lead. NS plus 100. With datum
N/S minus 380 the Brazilians gained 10 IMPs to lead 15-0.

{
Many players would rebid 1NT with Sementa's hand, thinking it
best to describe a balanced hand not strong enough for their
1NT opening. Sementa evaluated the hand as better for hearts
and raised Garozzo instead. With a small doubleton spade and
top tricks outside, who can fault his decision? South again had
a normal looking lead in the SK. What should declarer do? Garozzo
chose an unfortunate (for him) line by winning the spade and
returning the S4. Although Brenner went in with the SQ, crashing
the ten, his diamond switch proved effective.
Declarer won the ace and tried to tempt a heart cover by leading
the 10 from dummy, but Chagas was wide awake, following low.
Garozzo won the HA (the indicated play) and tried to cash three
clubs, throwing diamonds. Unluckily for him, South ruffed from
two small trumps and North had two trump tricks to come! In effect
Garozzo's spade play at trick two forced him into his losing
line, as South's defense was  fairly predictable, with that dummy.
Plus 100 NS [datum N/S -500] and 12 IMPs to Brenner/Chagas (ahead
27-0) when only one other declarer (Chemla) failed in 4H.

{
Ever since he opened 1C as dealer on Board 1, Gabriel Chagas
has been silent in the bidding, and this deal continues his quietude
(for a while). Note Garozzo's pass on a hand many of today's
hyperactive players would open. Although South had enough for
a third-chair 1S, the vulnerability and poor suit might have
dissuaded him. After a Drury-fit enquiry from North and a leave-me-alone
2S from South, East galloped in with a protective double, propelling
Sementa to a doomed 3H. Chagas chose to lead his partner's suit
rather than his CK, and declarer was given (false) hope.
He discarded a club from dummy on the spades, but when the HQ
was offside, he was booked for down one. Note that E/W have to
be careful to defeat 4S, leading diamonds before declarer can
get his losers away on the clubs. Chagas got a bit lucky on this
deal when his decision not to lead clubs didn't allow the contract
to make. NS plus 50 [datum N/S plus 30] brought the Brazilians
1 more IMP and at the halfway point in the match they led 28

{
Finally, some fireworks! Up to and including Sementa's negative
double, the auction was fairly normal. Chagas' 4S bid with the
best hand at the table was designed to tell his opponents as
little as possible (as his partner had "fully described" his
hand with 2S, North did not feel compelled to conduct a cooperative
auction). With a hand eminently playable in three strains, Garozzo's
5C (rather than a takeout 4NT) seems very un-Benito-like. 5D
doubled would be down one or two and 5C doubled was in minus
800-1100 territory.
However, Chagas obviously loved his partner's chances in 5S redoubled
to eschew the potential penalty available to him. Sementa led
a high diamond rather than his singleton club and Brenner did
well to scramble ten tricks by ruffing out the HK. A club lead
would have led to a faster down one by trick three. The mercurial
Chagas (although he claims he's mellowed!) was beside himself
at allowing his old rival to escape unscathed! Minus 200 N/S
was worth 10 IMPs to Garozzo-Sementa against the datum of N/S
plus 270. 10-28

{
Put yourself in Gabriel Chagas' shoes on this deal and try to
imagine his emotional state. He'd had a pretty dismal collection
of cards for five boards, and although he did not expect to lose
IMPs on any of them, he could not have known that he and Brenner
were up by 28 IMPs in the match until the fateful sixth board.
When he finally held a HAND, he was -200 for his trouble when
he might have been +1100. A close match, perhaps?! Now he's dealt
an everyday 0148 hand. Still, one of the hallmarks of the expert
is the ability to put a bad result behind him . . .
So Chagas/Brenner demonstrated on this deal, conducting a pretty,
natural auction (2H was fourth suit) to the excellent 6C slam.
On the spade lead Chagas had an easy 12 tricks, but what about
a D lead, removing dummy's entry to the second high heart? No
problem! Declarer ducks a D, wins the second diamond, cashes
the SA and runs trumps, playing it as a double squeeze. Here
West is squeezed in the red suits. +1370 NS, 3 IMPs against the
datum of N/S +1280. 31-10 now. Three other pairs tried 6C; two
made it, but Maas/Ramondt & Greco/Hampson bid/made 7C!

Another explosive deal. Every player took normal actions at every
turn, bit Sementa hit the target with 4S, cold for a doubled
overtrick. Chagas must have thought he'd done well to find a
club lead, but nothing mattered. Should either Brenner or Chagas
have known to bid on over 4S? From South's point of view, North
was probably going to lose two spades and an ace, and it looked
like he had enough defense to defeat 4S. North, who had already
bid his hand, was pleased to defend, holding an ace.
So common was it to play spades, doubled or not, that going minus
690 against 4S doubled (making five) cost N/S only 1 IMP (datum
N/S minus 670). At the other tables, East bid 5S whenever N/S
competed further to 5H, so that the only contracts declared were
4S and 5S, almost always doubled. Muller/de Boer, who did not
double, received an unexpected bonus of 6 IMPs. 31-11, Brazil.

{
The players were all relieved to be able to take a break from
the tension of the high-level decisions they'd had to make on
the previous three boards. Here, Chagas' decision to rebid 1NT
rather than the (obvious?) 2C illustrates the almost mystical
power that the Qx holds for some experts. The defense led jack
and another spade before switching to clubs, beguiled, no doubt,
by that 1NT rebid. Had they switched to hearts, ducking the first
or second to maintain communication, they'd have beaten 1NT.
As it was, Chagas made three when the DQ was onside doubleton.
Had North had made the (more normal?) rebid of 2C, South would
have given preference to 2D, and NS would have either played
there scoring plus 90, or the opponents would have found some
way into the auction (how?) and would have bid and made 2H. It
was particularly galling to Garozzo-Sementa to be minus 150 in
this fashion and the Brazilian plus netted them 4 IMPs against
the datum of . . . zero! With one board remaining Chagas-Brenner
led comfortably, 35-11.

Another partscore deal. Or is it? As it happens, N/S are cold
for 11 tricks in EITHER minor or 9 tricks if they declare notrump.
On lead against Garozzo's strong notrump the Brazilians had the
same 11 tricks available to them as they would have had in either
minor, so a penalty double might have proven lucrative.  Brenner
could have doubled but didn't, perhaps because, like many of
us, he'd not had great results doubling 1NT with medium-range
balanced hands.
Perhaps his partner could balance for him? Here, even if inclined
to do so (and who would, vulnerable?), Chagas was indeed prevented
by system from bidding 2D, which would have shown spades and
another suit. In the event, Brenner led a high club. Chagas overtook
and played back... another club, the natural play. When he threw
two low diamonds, Brenner did not find the last-chance diamond
switch, and with spades three-three, Garozzo had 7 tricks. N/S
were -90, and lost 6 IMPs (datum N/S +160). The Brazilians survived
to win the match 35-17 IMPs, 68-32 VP.

{
Match 8 sees two of the most aggressive pairs in the field (although
perhaps most of the pairs present today err on the side of aggression).
Daniela von Arnim and Sabine Auken of Germany -- Sabine is still
a German international even if she spends her time in Copenhagen
-- play a fearsome strong club with four-card majors, some esoteric
two-level openings, and a variable notrump. Howard Weinstein
and Steve Garner who played successfully for the USA in Maastricht
this fall, play a standard five-card major and 2/1 style but
overcall and preempt very light.
N/S have three trump fits to consider (spades, hearts, diamonds)
but as the scores from the other tables indicate, no game makes.
With the datum score plus 40 for N/S, stopping in the diamond
partscore was worth 3 IMPs for the Germans; they won the prize
for the briefest auction - the 3D response was natural and invitational.
The play in 3D is easy - declarer can ruff the club loser in
dummy, but even if the defence do not cash their spades at once,
the 4-2 heart split stops declarer obtaining a useful discard.

N/S can make a spectacular number of tricks in spades if they
guess diamonds right. By leading low from the South hand, or
running the DJ now or later, the diamonds play for four tricks
and N/S make game on a combined 17-count! As the datum (N/S plus
40) indicates, reaching game is far from automatic, and indeed
two E/W pairs who were left to their own devices bought the hand
in hearts. If the defence take their club ruffs, E/W can take
no more than nine tricks but both N/S pairs conceded 11 tricks.
Auken-von Arnim found their spade fit but did not bid the game;
Weinstein's forcing 1NT response to the 1H opening allowed von
Arnim to show spades and a minor, and Auken tried for game, leaving
Weinstein with nowhere to go - he could hardly bid 4H over 3S.
Von Arnim left her partner in 3S, and Auken followed a safe line
in 3S by drawing all the trumps and leading to the DA rather
than finessing.

N/S have two eight-card fits, neither of which is completely
solid, and all the outside controls. What is the the right level?
If you reach 7H, can you overcome the 4-1 heart break? The only
4-1 splits you can negotiate are the singleton ten or jack in
East - and that is precisely the layout here. The datum score
(N/S plus 1310) indicates that two pairs languished in game,
one pair (Brenner-Chagas) bid the grand slam. I bet Monsieur
Chemla's cigar was puffing pretty fiercely after that - he was
half of that unlucky E/W pair here.
Auken and von Arnim found their way to hearts - better than diamonds,
although at the six-level there is little to choose. I told you
that Weinstein is an aggressive preempter - is that your idea
of a second in hand vulnerable weak-two? Once Garner had raised
the suit and jammed the works, there was no way for the Germans
to get to the seven level, indeed on this auction with bad splits
far more likely, stopping in six was certainly wise.

{
4S by N/S essentially needs the HK to ruff out or the club finesse
with nothing too nasty in trumps - but nothing works here. 3NT
is far from a walk in the park either. There are seven top tricks,
and if North is declarer he could play on clubs and hearts to
establish an extra trick but, in practice, that would be far
from easy. The datum (N/S plus 100) indicates that only 3 N/S
pairs made 3NT, the rest of the field went down in game (2 in
4S, 3 in 3NT). So setting game was worth 4 IMPs for the defenders,
making 3NT was worth 7 IMPs for the declarers.
The key to the successful auction was that Auken showed hearts
and a decent hand at her first turn, and could then set up a
game force with her natural 2NT rebid. Both players bid out their
patterns, but with no eight-card fit it was obvious to play 3NT
now. Weinstein really had no choice but to lead clubs as the
unbid suit, did he? That was Auken's eighth trick; she thoughtfully
returned a low club to set up an endplay in one of the major
suits, but with the heart finesse succeeding she was home free.

{
This deal seems to have nothing of interest in it at all; N/S
have an eight-card spade fit that they cannot miss, or a safe
3NT, and enough controls that the only issue is whether the defence
can save the overtrick. At seven tables N/S duly recorded their
game - but one table produced such a sensational result that
we must ask just how it was that Lambardi-Lucena played 3C redoubled
down four. Or perhaps it would be kinder not to ask. This did
not affect the datum (N/S plus 640) as the top and bottom scores
are eliminated from the calculation.
Weinstein interrupted the relay sequence that Auken had set off
with her 2C bid - remember what I said about aggression by E/W?
- but Auken was never going anywhere but 4S after the limited
opening bid, and although von Arnim produced a courtesy cue-bid,
Auken signed off in 4S. The play record is incomplete, but all
logical sequences see North ruffing a heart or club in dummy
for ten or eleven tricks depending on what tack the defence take.

Another board that is all about the excitement of making an overtrick
in 3NT, or not. As yet Weinstein and Garner have done nothing
in the match but preempt a couple of times, with Auken-von Arnim
having taken a 16-1 lead in dribs and drabs. The datum score
here is plus 410 for N/S so the whole point of the deal is whether
the defence can hold declarer to nine tricks.
In a mini-notrump position, Auken showed a balanced hand within
her strong club methods by opening a nebulous 1D and rebidding
1NT over von Arnim's 1H, relay. On the spade lead, continuation
and heart switch, Auken led to the DQ and subsequently led a
low diamond from hand for three diamond tricks. Nicely done.
{This looks like a good moment to tell you that Auken-von Arnim
have put together two of the three high-place finishes by women
pairs in the big Invitational events. They finished 4th here
and 3rd in the Macallan Sunday Times recently.}

{
Par is for E/W to collect 50 against 3S, however only three pairs
in the field managed this; and Weinstein and Garner also bid
on to 4H, which just needed the trump finesse. Garner's 3D bid
was a Bergen-style mixed raise, even in competition, a method
that allows a jump raise to be purely preemptive. The reason
that Weinstein bid on over 3H was that, from his perspective,
his partner's assets might easily have been in diamonds or hearts.
More importantly, if there was a big double fit he would need
to get clubs into the equation.
The defence was thoughtful here - even though as the cards lie
it did not matter. Von Arnim led a top spade and shifted to ace
and another diamond, making sure that the diamond from dummy
did not go on the clubs. With the datum here minus 30 to N/S,
going one down in 4H cost E/W only 2 IMPs. The Americans trail
19-1 now.

{
With time running out for Weinstein-Garner in this match, their
opponents continued to play accurately, stopping here in 3NT.
Mind you, I suppose technically one might scramble home in 6D
with the aid of the heart finesse and the convenient fall of
the S10. No one managed this, but there were a couple of odd
results here. Garozzo-Sementa played 4S, and escaped unscathed,
making 650. De Boer-Muller played 3H doubled on the E/W cards
against Robson-Mahmood and early trump leads held this to just
four tricks for an 1100 present.
Auken-von Arnim employed a 14-16 notrump sequence; the 2S rebid
was forcing showing 4+S. The 3C bid was natural and identified
to Auken that her side had no fit, and thus 3NT was high enough.
The heart lead simplified declarer's task in playing for 11 tricks.
She knocked out the SA and subsequently ran her spades and diamonds
in the hopes of a heart-club squeeze. No luck today! But with
the datum plus 660 N/S, there was no swing - still 19-1 for the
Germans.

While there is no particular reason for N/S to get too high here,
you could imagine some players getting frisky with the North
cards in support of hearts, and South believing that his side
was safe at the five-level. Not tonight Josephine; 4H is the
limit, as one pair discovered to their cost. Mahmood-Robson attempted
5H down one, for a 9 IMPs loss; and Karwur-Sacul played 4S down
one (see below). Datum is plus 340 N/S.
This deal is meat and drink for the strong club - particularly
at favorable vulnerability, to silence East. Von Arnim's 1H bid
was natural or strong balanced, and her 3C bid showed the two-suiter.
Auken had a simple 4H bid now for a quick +420. Had Weinstein
preempted in diamonds, might he have jockeyed N/S into 4S? To
make this contract on East's heart lead, draw precisely one round
of trumps, then set up clubs for heart discards; score two hearts,
two clubs, a ruff in dummy, two ruffs in hand and three top trumps.

This was the Americans' big chance to get back into the match.
6S is not laydown, but it is certainly respectable. On a heart
lead you could flat out rely on spades and diamonds to split,
or you could can pass the CJ at trick two and combine some chances
- essentially you would need hearts to split now but might survive
5-1 diamonds. With two pairs out of eight (Hallberg-Simpson and
Engel-van Middelem) bidding slam, the datum was minus 790 for
N/S so bidding slam gained the adventurous pairs 12 IMPs, while
missing slam cost only 3 or 4 IMPs.
Weinstein and Garner got off on the right track: when Garner
raised spades, Weinstein could ask with 2NT; 3C suggested this
shape. But over 3H did the raise to 4H guarantee a singleton?
If so, should Weinstein have done more? He knew that Garner,
with terrible trumps, could not bid more than 4S. Von Arnim found
an effective diamond lead, which seduced Weinstein into tackling
clubs at once. Now a second diamond cut declarer's communications;
11 tricks. A very well-played match by N/S, who win 25-1.

A warm welcome to the pride of the Netherlands, Berry Westra
and Enri Leufkens. They are a permanent fixture at the Cap Gemini,
and have a formidible international record. Their opponents for
the match are Andrew Robson and the charismatic Zia Mahmood (the
only five-time winner of this event - with four different partners!).
They are the defending champions, and are keeping up the pace
from last year lying in second place at this time.
Zia immediately made his presence felt in the match with a typical
effort - the unbalanced 1NT opener! Robson transferred to hearts,
and Zia complied. Westra led the C8, in an attempt to get a ruff.
When in with the SK, he dealt Leufkens the club ruff! The defense
managed seven tricks for two down: plus 100 for N/S, and 4 IMPs
to the Dutch. [Datum N/S minus 60] An odd result elsewhere: Chemla-Levy

Zia-Robson do not play game-forcing 2/1 methods, so Zia was able
to give an accurate portrayal of his hand when he rebid diamonds.
Robson hoped the H10 would play a role, and that his doubleton
DA would be enough to get the  suit going. He decided to go after
the game bonus in 3NT. Leufkens led the H7, and indeed, Robson
was right about the H10 playing a role but Westra's diamond holding
would prevent Robson from setting up the diamonds before the
hearts could run. Westra cleared hearts, and the focus switched
to the South hand.
Robson played a club to the king and three rounds of spades to
endplay Leufkens for a seventh trick; two down: plus 200 for
N/S, 5 IMPs to the Netherlands. An unlucky result - the diamond
suit could have contributed six tricks (sometimes seven) rather
than one. A few pairs managed plus 110 in diamonds, and Auken-von

Westra's vulnerable overcall on the moth-eaten suit wouldn't
be everyone's choice, but the alternative of pass doesn't seem
to do the hand justice. He made up for the lack of a good suit
with the excellent side-suit structure. Zia's opening on the
right made Westra's red-suit holdings all the more appetizing.
If Westra's suit quality wasn't much to write home about, witness
Robson's suit for his preemptive 3S. Again, the alternative of
pass didn't seem to give the hand it's due. This got the general
nature of the hand across immediately.
Leufkens doubled 3S to give the heart suit a soap-box, and Zia
expressed his reaction to the 3S bid with a 4C cue-bid. Robson
returned the favor with a 4D cue, and Leufkens got around to
supporting partner's club suit with an auction ending 5C. Robson
received his two ruffs after the D5 lead, and declarer was down
two: minus 200 for N/S, and 5 more IMPs in the Dutch coffers.
This was because three tables attempted 3NT N/S for down four,
and two tables allowed E/W 620 in spades. Netherlands ahead 14-0
IMPs. [Datum N/S minus 370]

What can be said about a passed out board? Well, if Zia had known
he was down 14-0, he may have considered 1S or 2S on the West
hand.  From his perspective the first three boards weren't out
of the ordinary, and there didn't seem any reason to stray from
the partnership's methods ... at least not on this hand. Robson's
flat eleven-count didn't look very appealing in third seat with
neither side vulnerable, and he passed it over to Leufkens. The
"Rule of Fifteen" precluded South from opening this collection
as well.
Leufkens added his HCP to the number of spades held, and came
up two points short. Passed Out, and 3 IMPs to Leufkens-Westra.
A number of E/W pairs avoided trouble after opening, and stopped
in a spade partscore to go plus. The only other table to pass
the hand out: Garozzo-Sementa vs Engel-Middelem. The Dutch were
pitching a shutout against the defending champions, and led 17-0
IMPs. [Datum N/S minus 100]

{
When partner opens a five-card major 1H, and you hold the South
hand, there are a number of ways of going about describing it.
You could begin with a simple 1S, and see what partner has to
offer. You could make a forcing heart raise in your methods,
or you could splinter in support of hearts. Leufkens chose the
splinter approach burying his source of tricks. The splinter
promised an opening bid, this was just what Westra wanted to
hear. RKCB now seemed the best move forward, and Westra used
it immediately.
Leufkens 6C response showed a club void and one keycard (Westra
knew that to be the SA). It didn't seem that there were many
hands where the HQ wasn't present and Westra went straight to
7H. A trump was led, and declarer claimed thirteen tricks: plus
1510 for N/S, and no swing. It wasn't surprising that in this
quality field all eight tables bid the grand slam (Jassem-Tusynski
in spades). At the half-way mark of the match, it was still 17-0
IMPs in favour of N/S. [Datum N/S plus 1510]

Leufkens drew trump, and played a spade to his king, and ace.
West exited the H3 to the jack and ace. When the H8 came back,
declarer had little choice but to finesse; down one, minus 200

with a lead-directing 2D. Much to his surprise, he was allowed
to play it right there. Both North and South were dealt "death-holdings"
in the diamond suit - three small. Several other West's also
entered the auction with 2D on the theory that it couldn't hurt
to help partner with an opening lead if it came to that.
Zia bought a very useful dummy.  Declarer had five diamond tricks
and three kings when North obliged with the aces. Eight tricks:

2D, and several N/S pairs played in spade partscores, down one

The auction began in classic style. Robson, in third seat, could
have opened a four-card major but preferred to start with his
chunky club suit. Leufkens' normal vulnerable overcall gave Zia
the opportunity to demonstrate a textbook example Negative Double.
Westra expressed his values with a natural 1NT and East admitted
to his heart suit. South took a very rosy view of his hand, and
bid 3D at unfavorable vulnerablity.
This escaped unscathed when it went all pass. The HJ lead set
up a trick in that suit, and declarer lost one heart, two clubs,
a club ruff, and two diamonds. Down two: minus 200 for N/S, and
2 IMPs to E/W. At all the other tables, E/W played in a heart

This is where we see Zia at his best. Did he lead a diamond on

A further diamond and a heart left declarer a trick short: down

and he continued with the king. N/S ran their spade suit, and
found their only other trick was the DQ. Making seven tricks:
minus 90 for N/S, and no swing. At five of the other tables this
was the defense, and they all yielded minus 90. The exception
was the table with Karwur-Sacul N/S against Brenner-Chagas E/W.
Karwur was the only North to shift to a heart upon winning the
SQ. When he found himself in with the DQ, he set declarer a problem
when the second heart was returned. Declarer had to guess which
two of the three finesses were working. He guessed wrong, and
went down one. Full marks to Karwur. The final result of this

{
Wubbo de Boer-Bauke Muller have played together successfully
since the mid-80s and were on the Dutch team that won the Bermuda
Bowl in 1993. Their opponents: Brazilians Gabriel Chagas and
Diego Brenner, one of the most promising young South American
players. Both pairs employ fairly standard methods, so expect
judgment to play a big role in this match. Chagas seems to have
an uncanny knack for opening or passing at the right time and
here his atypical 1S opening hit a big fit and deprived E/W of
the clear run that might have led them to their cold 7C. 
After Chagas' featherweight opening and Brenner's raise to 4S,
things weren't so easy for the Dutch. De Boer's 2nd double implied
significant extra strength, so Muller was allowed to bid, and
I'm sure he was tempted. If de Boer had bid 5C at his 2nd turn,
Muller would surely have raised and may have had thoughts about
bidding 5S to invite 7C. Against 4S doubled Boer cashed the first
5 tricks and later got a diamond ruff: 4 down, N/S minus 800.
As everyone else was in 6C or 6H, datum was minus 960, so the
Brazilians gained 4 IMPs. {Your host Anders Wirgren}

When Muller passed de Boer's 14+-17 1NT opening, he could expect
it to make more often than not, so there was no need to look
for a better partscore. On Brenner's H4 lead, de Boer won in
hand and played on clubs. On the third, Brenner erred by discarding
a diamond instead of a useless heart. Chagas won the fourth club
and played a spade to Brenner, who could cash two heart tricks
and lead a diamond through. But when de Boer won the SA (Chagas
had discarded one) and cashed his last club, he discarded dummy's
high heart - and then the defense had the rest. 
Had de Boer discarded a diamond and played his spade, pitching
another diamond, Brenner would have been left with a losing heart.
Not easy, but a missed chance nonetheless. The datum was N/S
plus 30, so plus 50 was worth 1 IMP for Chagas/Brenner, now leading
5-0. The big result on this deal was achieved by the leaders,
Jassem/Tuszynski, who nailed Auken/von Arnim for 500 in 3C doubled
to gain 10 IMPs.

1NT would have been a comfortable contract, especially on the
likely heart lead, but Brenner tried to improve the contract
(or find a game should Chagas also hold four spades) and landed
in 2S on the four-three fit. That was a decent contract, and
when Muller led a diamond from the king, Brenner was off to a
running start. A heart finesse and a couple of ruffs gave him
six tricks, and after that de Boer won two club tricks and shifted
to a trump. 
Brenner cashed the ace and king and conceded the rest. Had he
instead played the CK from dummy in the three-card ending, he
would have made an overtrick. N/S Plus 110. As the datum was
plus 170, de Boer/Muller won their first IMPs, reducing their
deficit to 2-5. It is interesting to note that no one in notrump
(five pairs) took less than ten tricks, which was especially
good news for Garozzo/Sementa, who reached game.

Muller's double showed both majors, but would usually deliver
a bit more in terms of high card strength. De Boer gave up on
slam and settled for 4H. As Chagas' redouble had showed ace or
king of diamonds, Brenner could visualize a quick set, so he
doubled and led his singleton. That dummy had a club singleton
too was a small shock, but a good sign was that dummy had neither
the HK nor the SA. So, after winning the first trump, Brenner
put Chagas on lead in diamonds for a spade back. Perfect. 
And what a triumph for Dr Rosenkranz' convention! With the datum

{
The Brazilians invert the meaning of 1S and 1NT responses to
1H, so Chagas' 1NT showed at least five spades and created a
one-round forces. Over Brenner's 2D rebid, a jump to 3H would
have been invitational, so with enough to commit to game Chagas
had to go through fourth-suit forcing. His followup jump to 4H
indicated a sound delayed game raise, and now, with a sixth heart
and a five-loser hand, Brenner may have been tempted to bid on.
However, because he needed to find Chagas with specific cards,
and as Chagas hadn't forced with 3H over 3D (which he surely
would have with real slam interest), he decided to call it a
day. Muller did what we all would have done: he led a club and
saw declarer take all the tricks. Would he have found the diamond
lead against a slam? Hardly. Plus 510. The datum was plus 500,
so the board was a push. Chagas/Brenner were still in the lead,

Muller's 14+-17 1NT opening caught Chagas with a tricky hand.
His only alternative to pass was 2C (hearts and a minor), but
opposite a passed partner and a possible misfit, Chagas didn't
want to get involved. When 1NT was passed out and dummy tabled
jack fourth of clubs, Chagas must have been pleased with his
silence, as entering the bidding could easily have been bloody
for Brazil. He could not have been pleased with the defense,
however.
The CK lead gave away a trick, the heart discard gave away another,
and so did the diamond shift and the heart shift. A minor-suit
squeeze against Chagas gave Muller a tenth trick: N/S minus 180.
The datum was plus 50, so de Boer/Muller won 6 IMPs, trailing
now 9-12. Greco/Hampson also took ten tricks and they were in
game. Jassem/Tuszynski were plus 670 in 2H doubled! Forrester/Helgemo
collected 500 N/S vs Zia/Robson's 3NT doubled while Leufkens/Westra
got 500 E/W vs 2S doubled.

{
Opposite a hand with no four-card major, Muller's five clubs
would usually be worth lots of tricks, so his jump to 3NT facing
a 14+-17 notrump looks like a good gamble, even non-vulnerable.
Here, the clubs were useless, but the fourth spade wasn't. When
hearts were four-four and the DK onside, 3NT rolled home when
de Boer elected to play on diamonds instead of clubs. Both suits
broke four-two but the DK was where he wanted it to be, which
was not unfortunate.
If the S9 hadn't been a winner, de Boer would have needed two
tricks from one of the minors, with clubs offering better chances
than diamonds. How did he know? Minus 400 was the datum, too,
with all eight E/W pairs bidding and making 3NT, so neither pair
scored on the board. Chagas/Brenner were still in the lead, 12-9.
A clearly better line is to knock out the SA immediately. Then,
when South shows up with the ace, he will probably shift to a
diamond, removing all your guesswork.

Once Chagas had passed first in hand, Brenner thought it safe
to throw in a truly ugly 1S overcall. Not that it mattered. Muller
doubled to show four hearts, then offered a choice of games,
which de Boer converted to 4H on the strength of his singleton
spade and lack of aces or a clear source of tricks in clubs.
3NT would have been easy, but so was 4H. 
With both hearts and clubs three-two but the CQ offside, eleven
tricks were open-and-shut. Minus 650 happened to be the datum,
too, for the third push in the match. Still 12-9 to Chagas/Brenner,
going into the final deal. Every other E/W pair made eleven tricks

{
Chagas' double showed exactly four spades, and Brenner made a
slam try by cue-bidding 3H before showing his spade support.
4S wasn't an easy contract to play, however, with spades and
diamonds breaking badly, and the line Brenner chose didn't succeed,
although he was on the right track. After HA, SK, a spade to
the ten and the DA, he makes his contract if he guesses diamonds
are three-one with the CA in the East hand: the winning line
is to lead a low diamond (Brenner played ace-king). 
Then, with Muller on lead, Chagas' HQ protects against a heart
continuation, and if Muller gives de Boer a ruff, Brenner ruffs
the heart return, draws trumps and has his ten tricks (4 spades
in dummy, 1 ruff in hand, the HA and 4 diamond tricks). But this
is a double-dummy line, and with diamonds two-two and the CA
with West, you'll go down when the rest of the field takes ten
easy tricks. N/S minus 100. With datum 0, de Boer/Muller won
3 IMPs on the board to tie the match 12-12, a 50-50 draw. Two
pairs actually made 4S (Sementa, doubled), probably on a non-heart
lead.

In this match, Guy Van Middelem and Zvi Engel of the Belgian
team which qualified for the knockout matches in the 2000 Olympiad
will play against the youngest pair in the field, Geoff Hampson
and Eric Greco (USA), who have performed well as a pair for the
past 3 years in North American major events. Hampson has the
distinction of having played in a World Junior Bridge Team Championship
(1993 in Aarhus, Denmark) AFTER having played in an Olympiad
(1992 in Salsomaggiore, Italy). {John Carruthers, your host for
this match}
On our first offering, the Belgians reached 4NT on an invitational
auction after a 14+ to 17 NT. Twelve tricks are available on
any lead with the fortunate lie of the HJ and the CJ. All problems
were resolved at trick 1 when Greco led a heart and Engel was
soon claiming 12 tricks. NS plus 490 and no IMPs as 6 of 8 declarers
made 12 tricks. One of the declarers to make only 11 tricks was
Lucena of Argentina, who. unfortunately, was in 6H! [Datum M/S

The Belgians play a steady, middle-of-the-road style, with error
avoidance being their goal. The Americans, unlike many of their
age group, do not believe in unbridled aggression, but are perhaps
a tad more adventurous than their opponents. We'll see if the
results bear out these opinions. On this deal, getting to game
is the sole issue. [Datum N/S plus 380 after an appeal adjustment
at another table]
Van Middelem has a diffult problem when Greco steals his rebid,
and he solves it by passing. However, when Engel doubles for
takeout, he expresses his hidden values with a leap to 3NT. Another
fortunate lie of the cards means 3NT cannot be beaten. We see
this theme repeatedly, as expert pairs reach 3NT on minimal values,
scoring it up on a 'lucky' lie of the cards or an 'unfortunate'
opening lead or defense. N/S plus 600 for a 6 IMP gain as three
N/S pairs languished in partscores.

Playing in the Netherlands is almost like having a home field
advantage for the Belgians. They play here so often in tournaments
and practice matches and never have more than a couple of hours
travel to any tournament site in Holland and are very comfortable
in these surroundings.
They did well on this deal simply by avoiding trouble in a one-stop
3NT, makeable on any lead. Two pairs, Chagas-Brenner and Garner-Weinstein
reached the anti-percentage, but playable 6D, down 1 when declarer
had to lose the SA and a trump trick. Leufkens-Westra declared
5D from the North (!) seat, down 1, where either a club lead,
knocking out North's entry, or the spade ace and a ruff would
beat it. The Belgians scored plus 660 and plus 11 IMPs as only
3 pairs went plus with their cards; N/S ahead 17-0. [Datum N/S

{
The Belgians overreached on this deal when they bid to the greatly
anti-percentage grand slam in clubs. Engel took an odd view when
he doubled 3D - and van Middelem bid enthusiastically to the
seven level. For 7C to make, clubs need to be no worse than 4-2,
the SK needs to be onside doubleton (simplest) or singleton (with
the heart finesse). 6C is a decent good contract which will make
more often than 6S. Not on this deal however, where 6S did make
when bid by Maas-Ramondt for the home country, but 6C would not,
and in fact was never bid.
The Belgians did rather better than they deserved, losing only
6 IMPs against the datum (N/S plus 120), because three pairs
reached the inferior 3NT and were punished when diamonds were
led, clubs did not break, and the spade finesse lost! Reaching
the right game(4S) was worth 8 IMPs to the two N/S pairs who
managed this. The Belgians ahead 17-6.

Here we see the mystical Qx putting in another appearance and
seducing a player into rebidding in NT with an easy, natural
suit bid at his disposal. Eric Greco evaluated his 17 HCP as
stronger than their 15-17 1NT, but declined to rebid 1S, instead
choosing the more aggressive 2NT. Hampson had no problem passing
that. Had he rebid 1S instead, Hampson would also have passed,
and they'd have played there, making 2. Van Middelem, faced with
a selection of unappetizing leads against 2NT, struck gold with
his well-reasoned shot of the HA!
Receiving a loud come-on from South, he continued with two more
hearts, Greco not covering the 8. Left on play, van Middelem
found another decent shot, the S10, covered by the J, Q and A.
Now Greco could develop a second spade trick to go with his five
clubs and DA. One imagines him leering under the screen at Hampson
and pontificating, "I wouldn't have bid 2NT without the S9!"
N/S minus 120 [Datum N/S minus 100] and minus 1 IMP. It's 17-7
for the Belgians at the halfway point.

Geoff Hampson must have been a mite nervous when the dummy came
down, as he had unexpressed extras for his non-vulnerable overcall.
Van Middelem had found just the right level to shut him out on
the second round of the bidding. From West's viewpoint, surely
East would lose at least two of a club, a trump and a pointed
king. Van Middelem must have thought he had a chance for a pickup
when dummy came down, since all declarer needed for slam to be
a good bet was not to lose a trump trick.
Alas, Engel had a trump trick, and together with their CQ on
opening lead, that meant 11 tricks for East. It's reasonable
to assume that with trumps as good as AKQxxx and an outside K,
Hampson would have bid 4H over 4C, and a good slam would have
been reached. One imagines Engel leaning under the screen and
leering at van Middelem, "You open the bidding and I take both
tricks against their game?" N/S plus 450, no swing. [Datum N/S

situation immediately by leading one and trying to cash one when
in with the HK. Van Middelem did not take the spade finesse either
way! He drew trumps, led a spade to the Q and A, then ran
trumps, squeezing Greco in the black suits. His line is marginally
better than finessing either opponent for the SJ, since he has
the added kicker of dropping a doubleton J in either hand. He
could have improved on his line ever so slightly by cashing one
high club early in case of a singleton Q. NS plus 650, no swing;

Van Middelem's 4D opening bid is described somewhat cryptically
in their system notes as "tr S 11-16", presumably tricks in spades
and 11-16 in HCP. A Belgian version of Namyats perhaps, but not
quite as tasty as Belgian waffles. As 4S was declared by South,
West led S8, and in the course of pulling trumps, Engel threw
a H and a C from hand.
Now when he led the CK, Hampson pounced on it with the CA and
led a low heart. No one wants to look the fool by having an opponent
successfully underlead an ace, so South rose with the king. Engel
might have been better off throwing a diamond and a club on the
trumps. Then a successful heart finesse and a non-cash of the
CA would have led to an overtrick. No big deal. In any case,
it was N/S plus 620, but minus 1 IMP [Datum N/S plus 650]. The

to winning a world title -- in Maastricht this fall they just
missed out to Italy. Anton Maas and Vincent Ramondt have rcently
been part of the Dutch team. The Poles play Polish Club (what
else?), basically five-card majors and a strong notrump, plus
a few gadgets. The Dutch play four-card heart suits and strong
NT with some jazzed-up two level bids; more as appropriate.
Jassem's decision to pass over the 1H opening by Maas looks reasonable
-- neither double nor 1S look attractive, and 2D @#*%! However,
the consequence of his initial pass is to let the Dutch buy the
hand in 3H on a hand where it is easy for E/W to go wrong. They
could bid too much (as did five pairs) or too little, but 3H
was just right. Jassem's trump shift at trick two is very brave,
but alas, unsuccessful. N/S minus 170. Still, at least all it
costs is the overtrick. With the datum N/S -10, the Dutch break
on top by 4 IMPs. {Your host for this match, Barry Rigal}

{
E/W have two balanced hands with stops in all the suits and more
than enough high cards to attempt game (these days the magic
number in some circles for trying 3NT seems to be 21 rather than
26). Tuszynski's brave 2H bid does not disconcert Maas who makes
the same bid that he would have chosen without the intervention,
reaching the normal contract in admirably economical fashion.
Vincent Ramondt is the current holder of the Bridge Press award
for the best played hand of the year. He needs no such brilliance
on this occasion as 3NT has nine top tricks when diamonds behave
(Ramondt carefully leading the first diamond to the ace because
he can pick up all four diamonds in North but not South). Ramondt
runs his nine winners, but because the defenders have discarded
carefully to protect the key cards, it is, mirabile dictu, a
perfectly flat board. 4-0, Maas/Ramondt.

{
4H by E/W needs one of the minor-suit finesses, and with North
having opened the bidding it is not surprising that it is cold
as the cards lie. However, the Poles are not likely to defend
4H with a ten-card spade fit of their own, particularly since
Jassem has a way to show a constructive spade raise at his first
turn over Maas' takeout double -- by bidding 1NT -- which he
duly does. That lets Tuszynski take one of those two-way shots
when he jumps to 4S -- and Maas might briefly consider bidding
5H now, but discretion is the better part of valour today.
Maas leads a heart to the ace and Ramondt thoughtfully shifts
to a club, which might be necessary on a different layout. Tuszynski
can't reject the finesse here, and Maas takes his CK and the
HK, before it gets away: one down. Maas knows that if declarer
were 5125 he would not finesse in clubs, so he is not tempted
to play a club before taking his heart winner. (I wonder if that
is how Greco and Hampson let through 4S -- I'll let you ask them!)
As datum is N/S-120, (two pairs doubled 4S) N/S minus 100 here
represents a 1 IMP pick-up for the Poles, now trailing 1-4.

{
This deal represents a particularly tough bidding problem for
N/S, as they have two eight-card red-suit fits, and the key issue
is to identify the red queens to decide which slam is best. Strangely,
the answer is that notrump is optimal, since it needs only the
heart split and will not go down to any unlikely hostile splits
elsewhere plus it has some remote squeeze chances. But who could
play this hand in notrump? Answer: Auken/von Arnim -- well done
them! With the datum N/S plus 290 it is clear that the field
has found the deal as difficult as predicted.
If the deal looks tough, Jassem/Tuszynski brush the problem aside.
A strong jump shift and rebid leaves Tuszynski with no convenient
cue-bid and poor trumps, but far too many high cards to pass.
The solution is one of those blame-transferring five-of a-major
bids. Partner, you make the last mistake! Jassem has such good
trumps that he can bid 6H confidently. West leads the CA and
shifts to diamonds, but Jassem can claim when trumps behave.
Nicely done the Poles, for 12 IMPs, (five pairs played 6D down,
skewing the datum). The Poles now lead 13-4.

{
The Dutch strike back when the Poles bid aggressively and get
punished by an alert Maas. On the Western side of the Atlantic
the way to bid the North cards would be to open and rebid hearts;
bidding diamonds and then rebidding hearts shows a "good" (or
non-minimum) 6-4. Whether or not the Poles play this way (and
it looks as if Jassem might do just that) the final contract
of 4H is quite reasonable. After all, if hearts split you can
perhaps ditch a diamond on the clubs and ruff a diamond for ten
tricks, with some other chances too. Not today though, with the
bad heart split.
On a spade lead Tuszynski wins in hand to misguess the clubs.
(Might Maas take the CA with three trump tricks, and without
them, how could he double?) Tuszynski wins the spade return in
dummy, ruffs out the CQ, then goes to the DA to discard on the
CJ. Disaster! Maas can trump and lead a spade for Ramondt to
ruff with the H10, promoting an extra heart trick: minus 300.
After the club misguess declarer had to run the DJ at trick four
to go down one. The 6 IMPs (datum is N/S minus 80) leave the
Dutch trailing 10-13. By the way, how on earth did Brenner make
3NT here?

{
It is difficult to say whether Maas deliberately took a highly
distorted view of his hand or whether he missorted it. I simply
cannot see any justification for opening 1NT with his hand, so
let us be untypically charitable and assume he thought he had
the HJ as well as all his other 'goodies.' Mind you, some would
pass a 14+-17 notrump with the West cards, with all the high
cards outside the long suit. The net result of the combined "poor
views" was for Maas to finish in a contract with less than half
the high cards and trumps, vulnerable to boot.
Jassem's systemic lead is low from a doubleton, so his S4 helped
take one finesse for declarer, and Tuszynski's low diamond at
trick two took another finesse for him. When Jassem returned
a diamond that enabled Maas to keep leading diamonds to neutralize
a trump trick for N/S, and in the end he escaped for down one
(-100), rather better than might have been the case. In fact,
given the datum of N/S -20 (where East opened 1D, many tables
played 1NT by South, down on a diamond lead) this was a remarkably
cheap experiment at 3 IMPs to the Poles, leading 16-10.

{
The South hand is a normal 1S opening, but what should North
do now? One plan of campaign would be to try 2D, then 3D nonforcing
(the Poles had that available) but Tuszynski follows a far grander
plan by forcing to game and thus showing hearts first, to my
mind a dubious plan when nonvulnerable. This has the effect of
getting his side to 3NT with a misfitting 22-count -- well, at
least they beat my earlier prediction of 21 points being enough
to attempt 3NT!
3NT has some chances if the clubs lie very well or the key aces
are all with West. Here, however, Ramondt has an easy club lead,
and Maas has the key entry in diamonds to push the C9 through
at his first opportunity. That all leads to a painless two down,
and 100 to the Dutch. This represents 5 IMPs, given the datum
score of N/S plus 90, and the Polish lead is down to 1 IMP, 16-15.
N/S can make nine tricks (maybe ten) in diamonds without the
slightest trouble, but somehow it is not really surprising that
only half the field managed such a sane result as that.

{
After the fine Polish auction on board 24 it is the Dutchmen's
turn to get their own back by bidding to slam. On this occasion
it is a little unfortunate for the Poles that their opponents
reach 6C the wrong way up (played by East the hand is a pianola),
but how many Norths would underlead the SA at trick one to give
West a vicious problem? A look at the results from all eight
tables indicates that none of the three Norths with the chance
to do so found the play. Three pairs missed the slam (two to
play in 3NT by East) and two played the slam by East.
E/W use fourth suit to set clubs as trumps, but East cannot not
do this below 4C, which is an awkwardly high level (perhaps this
is a commentary on the initial 1H response?). Ramondt, West now
appears to take a bit of a flier to use Keycard Blackwood with
no spade control, but the consequence of doing that is to ensure
that Tuszynski could not underlead his SA. Furthermore, when
Jassem doubles the 5H response, that gets him off to the heart
lead that concedes 13 tricks: N/S minus 940. 5 more IMPs for
the Dutch (the datum is N/S minus 760), in front now by 4 IMPs.

{
When a layout like the N/S one in this diagram arises, where
a partnership has plenty of high cards and a big fit, but no
play for more than nine tricks, you might reasonably expect to
get a flat board for going minus 100 in 4H. And indeed, as you
can see from the datum score of minus 100, that is absolutely
the case; Lambardi/ Lucena did stop in 3H but with the top N/S
and E/W score eliminated, that did not affect the datum. In the
modern game (oh, perhaps in the older version too), you bid to
4H as N/S and dare your opponents to beat you -- if they can,
good luck to them. 
I believe the 3NT response to 1H is a game raise with no real
features, a very practical hand evaluation by Jassem. Tuszynski
signs off in 4H of course, and the club lead leaves declarer
with getting out for down one as his main preoccupation when
his only pseudo-chance of sneaking past the DA comes to nothing.
If one down is indeed good bridge, the N/S field did well on
this one. N/S minus 100. The Dutch lead remains at 4 IMPs, 20-16.

Another freak hand! Perhaps sensing something in the air Tuszynski
makes the remarkable decision to pass 2H. Apart from being rather
presumptuous about his side's prospects, Tuszynski's reticence
allows Maas to protect with 2S where 3D would almost surely have
bought the contract. Here the delayed 3D is ineffective and the
Poles sell out to 3S. The defense trades a second heart trick
for a heart ruff and Maas plays very carefully when a club comes
back: CK, SA, diamond ruff, HK, heart ruff, diamond ruff (Jassem
pitching clubs), SQ, claim. Plus 140. 
If Jassem keeps his last club Maas would have to cash the CA
(the dentist's coup) to extract South's exit card before playing
the SQ. With the datum N/S plus 30 that is another 5 IMPs to
the Dutch, who win 25-16, or 59-41 VP, in a generally well played
match. E/W have four tricks against a diamond contract whether
or not they arrange their club ruff. More important, however,
is to cash the SA before declarer discards the S10 on the HA.
The Poles lie second now, Maas/Ramondt tenth.

Indonesians Franky Karwur and Denny Sacul, recent winners of

gentlemen at and away from the table, they focus on partnership

to stay in the hunt. Their opponents, Wubbo de Boer and Bauke
Muller of Holland, Bermuda Bowl champs in 1993, are a further
24 behind . Our first deal, a partscore, is played successfully
in diamonds at every table but one (Auken/von Arnim fail in 3C).
Karwur/Sacul achieve par [datum is N/S minus 110] at 3D. However,
getting there is half the fun, as the old Greyhound Bus adverts
used to boast. Muller's (probably necessary) balanced takeout
double is hardly a classic, and de Boer shows no mercy, bidding
both his majors on very slender values. Sacul (1D showed 2+ cards)
saves the day by converting 3C to 3D, expecting 2/3 in dummy
on the auction. Muller leads a challenging low heart but Sacul
puts up the king: plus 110. {Your host for this match, John Carruthers}

{
The Indonesians reach 4H on this deal, which presents a choice
of games in either eight-card major-suit fit, or notrump. For
them, the choice between spades and hearts is never an issue.
They do it by virtue of never bidding spades! Karwur opens a
strong, artificial 1C and decides to describe his hand in one
more bid with 1NT. When Sacul transfers to hearts and offers
a choice between 4H and 3NT, there is no doubt in Karwur's mind
where he wants to play. 
The play is amusing - if someone asked you which three tricks
declarer lost in 4H, you'd be hard presssed to guess the HA,
HQ and H9. De Boer, unsuspectingly, leads the SJ, ducks the first
trump, and refuses to ruff "air" on the second round of clubs.
When he overruffs the third club to continue the attack on spades,
Muller gets a surprise ruff, but he is ruffing a loser, and declarer
can cash two more spades discard dummy's diamond loser. As any
of the three possible games might go down (each does once), N/S
minus 420 costs Muller/de Boer 5 IMPs. 5-0, Indonesia.

{
With 14 balanced HCP opposite 11 and no eight-card major suit
fit, N/S would normally reach 3NT on their own. Whether they
can reach the same contract after a weak 2H or Multi 2D by West
is not as clear. Six pairs manage this but Zia/Robson are nudged
into 4S, down 200 and Maas/Ramondt pass out 2H (N/S plus 100),
who allowed Garozzo & Sementa to play in 2H after the weak two
opening was passed out. Here DeBoer's 2NT puppets to 3C and 3H
shows four spades and a heart guard. All declarers in 3NT take
precisely 9 tricks, and De Boer is not severely tested.
After a heart lead to the king and a club return, De Boer starts
diamonds by leading the queen. Sacul takes the ace and makes
the good switch to a spade, won by Karwur, who can put declarer
to the test by returning another spade. However, declarer can
still make by ducking the second spade, finessing diamonds, then
trying to split each of spades and diamonds in turn. He would
make 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds and 3 clubs, but it would
be a struggle. NS plus 600 (datum N/S plus 520), and 2 IMPs to
the Dutch, ahead 10-5.

{
Denny Sacul takes advantage of the favourable vulnerability to
open a weak 2H on a bad suit and dull distribution but Bauke
Muller has an effective counter - a ump to 4C to show at least
five C and five S and a very good hand (strength ranges vary
from one partnership to the next but the idea is a sound one).
Karwur bounces to 5H to apply maximum pressure to North. De Boer's
4th spade is very big but his red kings may be worthless. Many
would double and perhaps a forcing pass would be best, but De
Boer tries 5S, reaching a precarious (but not dreadful) contract.
5S basically needs two of the three key cards (SK, CK, DA) to
be onside, as they will be approximately half the time. However,
there are also residual negative factors resulting from potentially
bad breaks. In any case, from de Boer's point of view the hand
plays like a dream. East leads the DQ to his partner's ace and
West kindly shifts to a club, clearing up that issue. Now, when
ace and another spade reveal that he cannot, after all, make
a slam (!), de Boer graciously claims the rest. NS plus 650 (datum
N/S plus 440) and 5 IMP to the Dutch, 15-5 at the half

{
It's very difficult, in an expert game, to achieve a flat result
at all tables. Here Seven of our eight N/S pairs reach 4S, all
taking 10 tricks on a club lead, thanks to the lucky spade position.
Odd men out are Hallberg/Simpson, who go down two in 3NT, which
they can make. At our table, de Boer's 2NT shows a limit raise
or better, 3C is a relay, and 3D announces a singleton somewhere.
Muller blasts into game. Karwur has an easy decision to make
on opening lead and cashed his clubs before getting off play
with a diamond to the king. 
Muller plays a low spade to his jack, picking up the trumps:
plus 420, the datum result. This trump combination offers some
choices. Muller's play picks up all the doubleton kings and singleton
king onside, losing to only to K103 or K93 of the ones he could
pick up. Leading the queen instead picks up doubleton king and
the K103/K93 combinations with a later finesse (West would have
singleton 10 or 9). Is the queen the better play? Before you
answer yes, consider the doubleton 109 in West. If you start
with the queen, you'll lose a trick to this combination. A standoff.
15-5.

{
The Dutch pair misses a very good slam on this board, handing
Karwur and Sacul an easy 12 IMPs (datum N/S plus 1310; only Chagas/Brenner
miss slam elsewhere). What goes wrong? The first two rounds of
bidding are normal for natural bidders, if a little uncomfortable
for Muller. The crux of the matter is on the third round for
both players, and it's easy to identify their respective fears
- Muller has bad trumps, de Boer a shortage of aces and top cards
in his main suit. Sometimes these hand types are difficult to
mesh.
There is no question, though, that Muller owes de Boer a better
bid than 4H (and he will be the first to admit it). Some would
bid 4D, agreeing hearts, showing a diamond control, and expressing
interest in bigger things, within context. Others might prefer
3D or a straightforward forcing 3H. Whatever your methods, with
4 trumps and all 3 outside aces, you MUST make some noise. De
Boer ruffs a spade while drawing two trumps. When both follow
he can draw the last and concede a spade. Would one not rather
be in 7H than 4H? 12 IMPs to Indonesia, ahead now, 17-15.

{
This deal illustrates how hard-fought the battle for a lowly
partscore can be at the top level of the game. Karwur's 1D is
the Precision Club catchall 1D, denying a strong NT, a 5-card
major, or a strong hand. It could show clubs or diamonds as the
main suit, or a balanced minimum. The Dutch overcall and raise
are normal, and it is back to Sacul, who needed at least another
king to act on the first round with this shape. Once spades have
been raised and N/S have limited their hands, however, Sacul
"knows" his side has a true fit somewhere, so he tries 2NT, minors.
The only downside for him is that Karwur, with precisely 3433
shape, might well pick clubs. All is well here and Karwur loses
a spade, two hearts, a diamond, and (with a correct guess in
clubs) one club to hold his loss to one off: N/S plus 50. With
datum N/S 70, the Indonesians gain an IMP, 18-15. Both Mahmood/Robson
and Jassem/ Tuszynski are plus 140 in spades to gain 2 valuable
IMPs.

{
De Boer and Muller open the lowest of touching four-card suits,
here 1C. As de Boer knows that his opponents have precisely eight
spades between them (the negative double shows four) he tries
1NT to get his sound opening bid off his chest and buys the contract.
East leads the normal SJ, creating a second stopper for declarer,
so Karwur shifts to his partner's suit, carefully choosing the
nine. At this point, declarer is faced with an interesting choice
of plays. With three tricks in the majors, he needs four in the
minors for his contract.
These can come from three clubs and a diamond, with the CQ onside
(plus a bit), or four diamonds (picking up the suit without loss).
Superficially, It looks as though the club play is superior in
that you can pick them up for three winners with tripleton or
doubleton queen onside, plus that pesky eight might fall, but
the entry position is awkward and with three diamond tricks,
declarer may still get a club trick later. De Boer concludes
that a diamond is the better play: one off, minus 50 (datum N/S
plus 10): 2 IMPs to Indonesia, 20-15.

We end with what seems a very routine 3NT, down when declarer
must let the opponents in with a club to cash four heart tricks
if they have not already done so on the opening lead. De Boer
has a truly junky 10-count and 1NT might occasionally be a chunky
14, but 3NT is the indicated action. Karwur leads the H9, consistent
with an honour-ten-nine combination or top of nothing, and the
Indonesians take the first four tricks. Muller does the best
he can, running his eight tricks and trying to squeeze East with
four-plus spades and the CK, but it is not to be. N/S minus 100.
This result is duplicated at six of the other seven tables. At
the eighth table, The French stars Chemla-Levy allow Robson-Zia
to steal 10 tricks (and 12 IMPs) in 3NT. At the other seven tables,
ours included, the score is N/S minus 100, no swing. Both pairs
have play quite well, with the Dutch having one rocky result
when they missed the good slam on Board 7. It cost them the match,
the Indonesians winning by 20 IMPs to 15, 55-45 in VP. A result
neither side wanted, but at least Sacul/Karwur are still in the
running for a podium finish. Muller/de Boer would be playing

With two rounds to go we will watch Maas / Ramondt take on our
leaders, Robson / Mahmood, last year's winners, and in a very
strong position now. Robson and Zia have a spectacular record
- they have won the last two Lederer Teams and, of course, last
year's Cap Gemini. A word of warning though: we saw Maas and
Ramondt beat the then leaders on Vugraph in match 12 - will history
repeat itself? Both pairs play standard methods though the Dutch
have a number of gadgets and their two-level bids are unusual.
{Barry Rigal, your host for this match}
3NT and 4S have next to no play - in theory, though either game
by West might make - but neither game has much chance from the
East seat. Of course, if South can by double an artificial fourth-suit
heart bid, then, even if West declares, he is dead in the water.
The Dutch were unlucky; Maas relayed over 1S with 2C, found a
balanced hand opposite, and blasted 3NT, leaving the wrong hand
on lead, and on a low heart lead was down two, at once. Four
Wests declared game successfully so the datum is N/S minus 200,
and our leaders break on top 7-0.

{
All but one pair played 4S but the deal is not without interest
- E/W have to work out that one of West's main assets is wasted
(make that CK into a working asset such as the CA and there might
be a slam). In first position at this vulnerability, the Dutch
play a 9-12 notrump and transfers. The table record shows the
auction above but I suspect that East bid 2H and West 2S, then
4C, splinter for spades - turning Ramondt off. Incidentally,
Garner/Weinstein were gifted 11 IMPs when their opponents were
the one pair to reach slam. The datum is minus 450 N/S.
At other tables West's initial pass should be enough to dampen
East's ardour. An inital Drury response by West (to show a spade
raise and maximum pass) will let East get his hand off his chest
with a jump to 4C - a splinter, again dampening West's ardour.
On a club lead, declarer can discard a diamond from dummy on
the CK and lose only one heart and one club or play for 12 tricks
(on the club return) by taking the diamond finesse and if the
DQ cooperates, discarding two hearts on the minor suit winners;
eleven tricks, N/S minus 450. Still 7-0 for Zia and Robson.

Another deal where six of the eight pairs record the same result:
3NT making 660 to set the datum score at that result. If East
overcalls only 1S then South can make a negative double, and
life is easy; if East jumps to 2S at his first turn, as he should,
life is tougher. A typical auction would be 1D-(2S)-(P)-(P)-3NT.
That last bid does NOT show a balanced hand - with 18-19 you
rebid 2NT and with more you open 2NT or the like.
The jump to 3NT shows a long solid suit (what's the DQ between
friends?) and spades stopped. Yes, you should have slightly more
in hearts. That was what happened here, and the play on the CQ
lead was unexciting. Robson took a first round diamond finesse
and then knocked out the SA. Maas failed to shift to hearts;
plus 660 N/S [the datum score]. The excitement on this deal was

Seven of our eight pairs play the deal in hearts - although it
is hardly easy for N/S to get into the auction. As you can see,
Zia took a risk when he doubled 2C (normally a good hand, takeout
of diamonds). Well, he did very well, in a sense, as 2H is cold.
But Robson takes his partner seriously and competes to 3H. On
a diamond lead to the DJ and DQ Robson plays a club back - hoping
East will duck. No such luck; Maas wins, plays a second diamond,
and the defence cash out the spades for down one.
The datum score is N/S minus 30 so this is worth an IMP to the
Dutch, trailing now 7-1. As to par on the board; well, 3D is
a fascinating contract by East. On a top heart lead and club
shift East can win his CK, cash the DA and run four rounds of
spades with the aid of the finesse. South ruffs in, a club discard
from dummy and North; now the third club lets the defence take
their trumps separately for down one. So I think Robson had to
sell out to 3D to achieve par.

This looks like another relatively quiet deal, with E/W likely
to bid and make a partscore in a major, and N/S down a trick
or two in their diamond partial. And this is how events transpire
when Maas takes the low road with his moderate hand. He elects
to double 1D rather than bid 1S - the latter being the majority
position, I believe. When Zia jumps to 3C, a 'mixed raise' showing
6-9 HCP and four trumps, typically unbalanced, Maas sells out,
leads the SK but still has time to shift to clubs in the middle
game; two down.
The datum here is N/S minus 210 so there is no swing in our match
- yet again. Zia and Robson lead 7-1 at the halfway point, still
28 VPs ahead of Garner-Weinstein, with the Poles 19 behind them.
By the way, Karwur-Sacul climbed to 4H on this deal and justified
their overbidding by making no less than 11 tricks! On a diamond
lead declarer could not take more than ten tricks, so the defence
perhaps led trumps. That solved one guess - all that was left
was to negotiate first the spades, then finally the clubs; a
well-earned plus 450.

{
With N/S not cold for any game, collecting a vulnerable penalty
here should not be too bad for N/S, you would have thought. This
is not necessarily true though, as Zia and Robson discover. Perhaps
Ramondt was lucky to find such a safe haven when he ran from
1D doubled - but there again you could argue that he was unlucky
to have got caught in the first place! 1H doubled has seven top
losers, given that the defence are fairly sure to take the diamond
ruff, but that appears to be the limit. Zia's trump lead seems
sensible enough to me.
Maas wins the HK, plays a second trump to hand, then leads diamonds
and wisely gives up on trying to make the hand. The defence duly
cash out, after setting up their club winner, for down one by
eventually taking the ruff. So why does 200 lose 3 IMPs [Datum
is N/S plus 310]? Well, five pairs defended one-level contracts
(one beat 1H redoubled 400, one beat 1D doubled 500) and two
pairs were allowed to make game; 4S and 5C both seem tough on
trump leads but my margin is not wide enough to analyse them).
The Dutch trail 4-7.

{
Another small board; Maas and Ramondt take the sensible road
and stop low in 2H. Perhaps Zia had to double 1H to bring spades
into the picture for his side but the fate of 2S is far from
clear although two declarers brought in contract. If E/W push
on to 3H over 2S, it figures to go down - eight tricks appear
to be the limit in hearts. The datum is NS minus 10 so if Maas
makes 2H it will be worth 3 IMPs and level the match.
In 2H Maas receives the friendly diamond lead and wins the DJ
in hand to lead a spade. Zia takes his SA, and shifts to clubs,
and the defence take their ruff before playing a second diamond.
Maas wins in dummy and thoughtfully pitches his DK on the SK
before coming to the point of the hand, the heart guess. With
only one entry to dummy he must decide if South has a small singleton
heart or an honor. Given Zia's failure to double 1H, I think
Mass did very well to guess the trumps, don't you? Our match
is 7-7; a partscore swing to Weinstein-Garner closes the margin
to 15 VPs.

Finally an action board - we have been waiting for one all set.
The Dutch come out on the right end of it when they get an effective
lead-directing bid in and create problems for Zia in the play.
Left to your own devices as South you would have no problem in
making 4S. You would cash a top spade run the S10, and put the
cards back in the board. Well, that would not take into account
Maas' decision to come in with 3D after Robson raises spades
- that is a big bid but you can see how well it works.
After three rounds of diamonds when Zia ruffs with the SJ, he
can still succeed by taking the double finesse - but why should
he? Instead, he plays Ramondt for a doubleton S9 by running the
S10 on the second round of the suit - I would have expected him
to play Maas for the doubleton SQ but that fails too. The datum
is N/S plus 140 when everyone plays 4S but only three declarers
are successful; 6 IMPs to the Dutch. Garner/Weinstein wrap up
4S and are behind in the event by 1 VP!

{
More good news for the Dutch when they bid to the normal spade
game to wrap up 11 tricks and discover that is another small
pick-up. Ramondt unleashes a piece of germ warfare; 2C shows
both majors, and the 3D response to the relay shows five hearts
and a non-maximum, I believe. Maas settles for 4S. Zia leads
a low diamond and dummy's D8 wins the trick, and Maas draws trumps
at once. Now he could take 12 tricks by playing on hearts, but
he has a safe way to make 650 by ruffing out the DK and discarding
a diamond on the CA, and does so.
This does not look so exciting, but note the vulnerability. While
you would expect to be able to get to 4S in the face of preemption,
not everyone managed the task, so the Dutch pick up 4 IMPs [datum
is N/S minus 520]; ahead 17-7. Two E/W pairs got this wrong -
one playing 6S and against Garner-Weinstein, 4H. That contract
should make I believe, but it did not and Garner-Weinstein won
12 IMPs. They are at the maximum VPs for this match and cannot
get more points themselves.

{
The Dutch pick up their fifth consecutive moderate swing on the
final deal of the set, when they climb to a delicate game and
find the cards cooperating nicely. When Robson overcalls 1H with
the North cards, Maas' 1S bid promises only four - double would
deny spades. Now Ramondt is carried to 4S by the momentum of
the auction it seems, but Zia does not know he would have gone
there anyway. With a singleton, trump control, and facing a vulnerable
overcall Zia risks an action double - possibly based on the state
of the match. It never works for me either.
Zia leads his singleton diamond and gulps at the sight of dummy.
The defence get their ruff but that is only the third trick for
them; 790 for Maas/Ramondt, who win 23-7. Note that no other
defence works better, but on a club lead declarer will not be
enamored of the idea of leading spades from dummy - still, what
other chance does he have? Another huge result for Garner-Weinstein,
who save in 5C over 4S - perhaps South jumped to 3C or 4C as
a fit jump at his first turn. The Americans' blitz has moved
them from 47 behind to 9 in front - what a great run.

{
With one match to go, Americans Steve Garner and Howard Weinstein,
in their first World Top Tournament ever, are leading the field.
And now they are facing fifth-placed Brazilian stars Gabrial
Chagas and Diego Brenner. A last-round match with lots of money
- and pride - at stake. Both pairs use standard methods: five-card
majors and strong 1NT. And just to show that the players feel
the tension, Weinstein and Garner start by missing a good slam,
reached by three pairs.
In strong 2/1 systems not everyone treats the "high reverse"
(e.g. Weinstein's 3D) as unambiguously strong. Thus, Weinstein,
minimum for 3D, settled for 4S. With the "right" singleton, good
trump intermediates and a fitting heart honor, however, that
looks wrong to me. It would be useful here to be able to separate
strong and weaker slam tries. N/S Minus 480 (datum N/S minus
570), 3-0, Brazil. Are Zia/Robson destined to repeat? They defeat
6S! Perhaps: C, C, SK (J), DQ, DA, diamond ruff with the SA,
spade to the eight . . .  {Your host for the match Anders Wirgren}

{
Would you double 1D on this South hand? I think it's borderline,
but the lack of intermediates in the suits would turn me off.
Not the youthful Brenner, though. Garner redoubles to show strength,
which looks dangerous with only 10 HCP and a singleton spade,
and Chagas jumps to 4S as a two-way shot. Weinstein has a suitable
hand to double (no sure thing, however), and in due time the
defenders get their four top tricks. One down; N/S minus 100.
Since the datum is plus 50, Garner and Weinstein gain 4 IMPs
to lead, 4-3.
It's surely tempting to bid 4S with Chagas' hand, and I can't
imagine anyone not doing so, but perhaps it's the wrong approach.
Those heart honors and four diamonds hint that the opponents
are unlikely to make game, so the main objective should be to
go plus. And when the sound of the auction makes it likely that
partner's double is shaded, why punish him for enterprise? The
conservative approach would gain 3 IMPs (for plus 140) while
the "normal" jump to game is a clear loser this time. Am I ready
for therapy?

{
With 12 HCP and a fit for his partner's opening suit, Chagas
decides to bid out his pattern. If the HK isn't pulling weight,
however, he knows he's verbidding, and if it does have some value
what's the point of painting a picture of his distribution? 3NT
is a bad contract on the "marked" heart lead, but perhaps it
is not so marked, after all, because Garner chose a low spade
instead, handing declarer his ninth trick immediately. And when
he didn't shift to hearts either, Brenner managed an unlikely
overtrick. N/S plus 630 (datum plus 530), 3 IMPs to Chagas/Brenner,
6-4.
3NT was also playd at seven of the other tables, and made no
less than six times (only Auken/von Arnim defeated it). Forrester/Helgemo,
who judged nicely to stop at 2NT, lost 8 IMPs for their accuracy.
Maybe the heart lead isn't so easy to find, after all ...

{
In these days of weaker and weaker initial actions, a hand which
once upon a time would universally have been treated as a maximum
weak two-bid, is nowadays often opened with a one-bid. As here.
But Garner's "weak one-bid" doesn't get his side overboard when
he wisely passes over Brenner's overcall, rebidding his hearts
only after Weinstein's competitive double. 2H is a safe contract,
and even if the defenders don't cash their four top tricks immediately,
the four-two spade split means they can't really lose them. N/S
minus 140 was the datum too.
Chagas/Brenner retain the lead, 6-4. If North-South go on to
3C, and East-West let them play it, the defense has to cash two
tricks in each major and lead a third spade, for a trump promotion
to defeat the contrtact. Chemla/Lévy, the only pair allowed to
play 3C, actually make nine tricks for a 6-IMP gain.

{
It's easy to get carried away when you have a good hand and your
nonvulnerable opponents mess things up for you. And that is exactly
what happens here, Garner committing to slam once Weinstein shows
some heart length and at least three-level values. There are
enough warning signs, however (dangerous diamond holding and
the prospect of at least one bad break), that a cooperative effort
is likely to be a better approach than bashing. My yardstick
is this: If I tabled this East hand on this bidding, would I
expect it to be a good contract. Here I'd say yes.
If you get the impression that I don't care for Garner's 6H bid,
you're right. On the CQ lead, Garner needs to bring in the trumps.
Two down: N/S plus 200 (when the datum was N/S minus 490) means
another 12 IMPs to Chagas/Brenner, now in the lead by 14 IMPs,
18-4. Maas/Ramondt go down in 5H but everyone else stops safely
or settles for a penalty against 5C doubled.

{
Gabriel Chagas is widely regarded as a declarer who finds a way
to make the toughest hands. Perhaps that is why he doesn't make
his 1NT contract on this deal. Garner wins the heart lead and
shifts to a low spade. Chagas' first chance to make his contract
is to go up king and establish his fifth diamond, but he ducks
and the defense knocks out the HA. When Chagas leads a club from
dummy and Garner plays second hand low (the queen is often the
better play), Chagas' nine draws the king.
Weinstein cashes his heart winner and plays a spade to the ace,
but on the return of the C10 Chagas doesn't finesse. Instead
he goes up ace and cashes the SK, hoping either to drop the CQ
or that a squeeze would materialize. Minus 50. The datum is plus
70, so Garner/Weinstein gain 3 IMPs on the board, reducing to
their deficit to 7-18. The Belgians are three down in 3NT but
everone else makes 1NT or a club partscore with the N/S cards.

Chagas' 1S response is an artificial one round force with less
than five spades (like a forcing notrump), so Brenner is deprived
of the option of "raising" spades on his three-card support.
Not that I think he would do it anyway with three small "trumps"
and two honors sixth in hearts. When he rebids hearts, Chagas
upgrades his hand and simply jumps to 4H. Missing the H8, Brenner's
first problem is which hand was more likely to hold all trumps
if they are 4-0.
He guesses East, as the lead (lowest from odd, third from even)
makes it likely that Garner has led from a five-card suit. But
when the HQ reveals that trumps are breaking, the rest of the
hand is basic stuff: draw trumps and lead towards the black honors.
Plus 450. No swing aginst the datum, which also (surprise, surprise)
is 450. Chagas/Brenner in the lead by 18 to 7.

It's not often that the opponents want to play in a suit in which

a part of the world (i.e. North America) where it's more or less
standard to overcall 2H (natural) on the first round. Or is the
truth that he can bid 2H, but doesn't dare to? As it is, the
other side can make 2H, but Weinstein errs in the play in strange
fashion, losing a needless trick to the SK, the defenders' sixth
winner.
Plus 50 is worth another 6 IMPs for "The Boys from Brazil," the
datum being N/S minus 190. The lead is now up to 24-7. Should
East-West reach 3NT, as Leufkens and Westra do, they can make
with the a double finesse in clubs. The other four pairs in 2H
either make it (East/West) or go three down (North/South).

Garner's 3H response shows three spades, a singleton heart and
five-four in the minors, either way. Yes, that is what he has,
but to me it doesn't look like a fair description of his hand.
Not with three small spades, "eight high" in his longest suit
and the singleton king. And he must be worried that 4S isn't
their best game. But it is, even though 3NT also would make easily
enough. When the SQ makes an early appearance and covers the
deuce rather than the nine, Weinstein's only concern is an overtrick.
As it happens, he can't find one: N/S minus 420. The datum was
is also minus 420, so the final result of the match is 24-8,
63-27 for the Brazilians. Garozzo/Sementa are the only E/W pair
to go minus, going down in 3NT and went one down. Could it be
that one of them did lead the S9 from West on the first round
of the suit? Zia/Robson have a good match against the Poles (aided
largely by Board 21) and sweep past Garner/Weinstein to become
the first defending champs to repeat the following year. The
Poles are third, the Indonesians fourth, the Brazilians fifth,
the Germans 6th.
