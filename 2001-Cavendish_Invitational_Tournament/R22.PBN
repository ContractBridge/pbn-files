{
It is time for another top encounter: second placed Claudio Nunes
and Fulvio Fantoni (E/W) against third placed Bob Hamman and
Nick Nickell (N/S). South had the type of hand that makes you
want to play a different system than Standard. However, all was
well when North didn´t pass over 1D. In 3NT, if declarer gets
a diamond lead he must produce a ninth trick on his own, but
dummy´s first suit wouldn´t be many players´ choice.

{
Hamman made a good choice when he passed over Nickell's 1S instead
of bidding 1NT or take a club preference at the two level. West
led a heart which Nickell took with dummy´s ace to play another
one. He was hoping to make four trump tricks, two aces and a
ruff in dummy. East inserted the queen to win the trick. Perhaps
he should now be able to visualise declarer´s hand: clubs, spades,
three hearts and one or two diamonds. There was no hurry to play
on clubs. A trump looks more tempting.

[Contract "4H"]
[Declarer "W"]
{
Is it possible that West´s hearts could be longer? Why else would
East bid 4H and not 4S. Perhaps he hoped that his HA would be
enough to allow drawing trumps and then rely on diamonds. He
was partly right - 4H is a better contract. But with both majors
splitting 4-2 there was no real chance to make game. Clubs were
led and continued, the DJ was allowed to hold the trick. Now
declarer played three rounds of spades, ruffing with the ace,
a good choice, as he would have gone more than one down otherwise.
