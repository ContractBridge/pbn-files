{
Our next featured pair are from Italy: Alfredo Versace is the
current holder of the World Olympiad Teams and the Rosenblum
Teams. Lorenzo Lauria, Alfredo's regular partner was in Italy,
and in his stead we have Valerio Guibilo. They are joined in
battle by Howard Weinstein and Steve Garner of the U.S.A., who
are a hot pair at the moment having just won the Cavendish Teams.
I will have to check if this is allowed - an Italian pair bidding
completely au natural, with nary an artificial call to be seen.

{
Guibilo's strong and possibly artificial 2C received a positive
and natural 2S from Versace. The 2NT bid announced 22-23 HCP,
and 3D was Checkback-Stayman. 3H was natural, and 3NT was a suggestion
of contract with five spades. Versace wasn't interested in pushing
two balanced hands in the 31-32 HCP range to the six-level without
a fit. If partner could move after 3NT, then there would be a
re-assessment. It's just as well they stopped where they did.
Garner led the H4, and declarer won the king. The S2 went to
declarer's ace, and the S10 was played to the queen, and king.

{
Versace-Guibilo conducted a simple Stayman auction to 3NT. Indeed,
most of the field had the identical auction. Only the vaguaries
of the notrump ranges altered the auction. The D10 would be the
choice of most defenders - maybe an esoteric CJ here and there.
Versace won the queen in dummy, and showed subtle technical expertise.
He led the S9 (unblocking the internal spade spots) to his queen,
and the H5 to the king. The C3 went to the king, ace, and jack.
Now, the H6 towards dummy's Q72. This catered to a doubleton
ace of hearts in West.
