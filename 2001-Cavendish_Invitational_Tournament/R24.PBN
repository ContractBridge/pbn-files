{
Time for American super stars Nick Nickell and Bob Hamman to
say hello to one of the pairs that won the Cavendish Teams earlier
in the week, Americans Roy Welland and Björn Fallenius. OK, my
former team mate Björn is still a Swedish citizen, but he has
been living in USA for the past ten years or so. Maybe time to
think of him as an American. They are doing well in the pairs,
too, and lie sixth after two sessions.

{
East/West have only 28 HCP, but every one of them are working,
and East has enough distribution to make 6H or 6C a good bet.
Once Hamman opened the bidding on his 10-count with all honors
in the long suits, there was no way to stop Nickell below slam.
2NT was a balanced game-force, and even though Hamman denied
any slam interest (by raising 3H to 4H) he also denied a balanced
minimum (else 3NT over 2NT), so there figured to be play for
twelve tricks.

{
Blacks versus reds, and vulnerable versus not. No wonder that
the big black spades won the battle, especially with a vulnerable
game at stake. But should they have? Fallenius' pass over 2H,
then 3S over 3D, suggested good defense against hearts, so Welland
was probably hoping for too much when he bid 4S. But it's easy
to understand why he was tempted; I would probably have been
myself. And had Hamman led a heart, Welland would have made it!
