{
East bypassed his 4-card diamond suit to respond one spade, and
didn't attempt to play the partscore in clubs when West rebid
one notrump; 10 HCP figured to suffice for one notrump in any
case. North's D10 lead was more attractive than a heart from
his perspective. That gave declarer timing to set up clubs. When
in with the CA, South shifted to the H3.

{
A slightly shaded third-seat one-heart opening and ordinary minimum
two-heart raise put North and South on the road to minus 200
(down two, vulnerable, not doubled). East, however, saved them
with a balancing takeout double on a square hand, and West duly
bid three clubs.

{
Look at South's hand and the auction as he saw it at his first
turn. I'd fear an East-West diamond slam, wouldn't you? Little
could South imagine that North had two trump tricks against a
diamond contract, so he continued North's preempt by jumping
to five hearts. West must have been delighted to administer the
Axe.
