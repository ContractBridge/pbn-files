{
For the next nine boards we feature Geir Helgemo and Sam Lev,
East and West this round. The North-South route to three notrump
figures to be duplicated at most tables. What would you lead
from the East hand if your hearts were H-QJ1042 instead of the
actual H-QJ1082? A low heart would be right. This inference let
West overtake East's HQ to unblock.

{
East's minimum opening started East-West along the road to four
spades traveled by many other pairs, but North created a detour
with a "weak takeout" sandwich one notrump. West doubled South's
two-heart advance for takeout and then stopped gingerly in three
spades. North's H10 lead dislodged dummy's HA, and declarer,
relying on North not to have it for his weak takeout, lost a
finesse to North's SQ.

{
In the absence of a good fit, North restrained himself and stopped
in a most comfortable three notrump. East's diamond lead meant
one overtrick even if diamonds hadn't split, and the 4-3 division
of the spades produced a second overtrick.
