{
Lots of cards but no fit is a dangerous combination, because
there is always the temptation to overbid. But world champions
Nick Nickell and Bob Hamman have no trouble stopping low when
Hamman takes an invitational route to 3D, burying his clubs in
the process. Incidentally, if you want to be in slam, clubs is
the best denomination - but that doesn't mean 6C makes on this
deal (it doesn't).

{
 When the opponents stop in 1NT, it often pays to compete for
the partscore if you have a little distribution, and Versace
deems his nine major suit cards enough for a two-suited bid in
the pass-out seat, not caring about the vulnerability. He buys
a lot of high-card points, but no fit, and poor Guibilo is left
to struggle in 2S on a four-three fit after trying for game with
a two-step route to that contract.

{
Although the Italians employ a little science, it doesn't help
them to reach the best contract on this deal - not that finding
5D is easy in any system. 2C is strong and artificial; 2D is
negative; 2H is either natural or a balanced hand with 25+ HCP;
2S is a relay; and 2NT shows the balanced powerhouse. Then, Versace
uses Stayman and signs off in 3NT when there is no 4-4 heart
fit. In an ideal world, the weak hand is able to describe what
he has instead of asking what his partner has, leaving the strong
hand in a position to judge the best strain.
