{
Jean-Christophe Quantin and Michel Abecassis of France finished
fifth last years and are back in Vegas to fight for money and
glory. Their opponents in this round have already achieved that,
by winning this year's Cavendish Teams. Both pairs are in contention
after two sessions: the French are fifth, the Americans are sixth.
Here, East/West have a perfect fit, which makes 6C more or less
laydown. And even though the French get off to a good start,
they don't really manage it.

{
With two stoppers in spades, 3NT is an easy make, but difficult
fo find unless East protects with 2NT over 2S. 5D is also excellent,
and that is what the French played. Abecassis must have had doubts
about his SK value, but since he could have bid 3D over 2S with
only competitive values, I think a non-forcing, but constructive,
3D over 3C is more what his hand is worth.

{
Welland's dangerous-looking weak jump overcall, red against white,
was treated by a support double (exactly three diamonds) by Abecassis
and left in by Quantin. Left on their own, East/West may have
found their way to 6C or 6D, two excellent slams, which happen
to go down on a heart lead. Now, they had an easy 500 available
and didn't stop to look further. Abecassis shifted to a trump
at trick two, and later dealt Quantin a heart ruff, for plus
500.
