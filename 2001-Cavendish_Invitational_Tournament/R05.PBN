{
Last year압 champs take on a Norwegian-US (ex-Israeli) partnership.
Geir Helgemo, another European who will represent his country
next month, is a world superstar, but maybe best known as a member
of Rita Shugart압 successful team for a number of years, partnering
Tony Forrester. His partner is Sam Lev of New York, recent winner
of the Maastricht Transnational Teams and the NEC cup in Japan
(both times on an e-bridge team), and successful in almost every
tournament.  After an uncontested auction E/W ended up in 2C.

{
Fleisher압 weak 2H would probably not have been his choice in
first or second hand but in third it makes perfect sense. North
doubled, and although he had 14 HCP and got a positive 3C from
partner, the contract couldn앖 be made. Three hearts and two
aces had to be lost.

{
Too strong for 1NT, Rodwell opened 1D and jump-supported Fleisher압
1H response. Fleisher had an easy raise to game. No lead could
endanger the contract. Lev chose a club. Fleisher won with the
ace, and did not bother to try any finesses, playing ace and
another trump. All the defenders could get was a trump, a club
and a spade. Ten tricks: N/S minus 420, and 12 IMPs for Fleisher/Rodwell
(One pair ended up too high and went one down).
