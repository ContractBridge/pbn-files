{
With fifteen boards remaining, we'll take a closer look at the
proceedings at the table where Geir Helgemo of Norway and Sam
Lev of USA, lying second after four sessions, take on Americans
Billy Miller and Curtis Creek, lying tenth. Neither pairs has
done very well in the session so far: Helgemo/Lev have won 31
IMPs, while Cheek/Miller have lost 81 IMPs. Deeming his hand
too strong for a heart rebid, Miller improvises with 3C on a
three-card suit, a strategy I've always considered very dangerous.

{
Expecting his opponents to be cold for game, Cheek digs up a
tactical 1-level response, but Lev have enough cards and enough
distribution for a take-out double, and after that Helgemo/Lev
won't miss anything. In view of his excellent intermediates,
Miller rebids 2C where a pass may have worked better (but only
if Helgemo bids 1NT and Lev passes, a not so likely occurence)
and after that, the doubling begins.

[Contract "4H"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
Once upon a time, this deal could have been passed out. But today
there are pairs climbing all the way to 4H. Like Cheek and Miller.
On a bad day even 2H would be too high, but here the defenders'
cards are where declarer wants them to be - except for the CQ.
And if the defense attacks spades in time, they get to four tricks.
But Helgemo doesn't lead a spade, starting with his singleton
instead.
