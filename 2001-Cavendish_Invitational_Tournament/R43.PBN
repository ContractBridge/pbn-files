{
Time for the leaders after four sessions, Brad Moss and Fred
Gitelman, to meet another North American pair, Mark Lair and
George Steiner, who are lying in twelfth place. On the first
board of the round, East/West have only 21 HCPs, but with ten
combined trumps all they need is the SA in front of the king
(OK, trumps 2-1 too). And since it figured to be there, in view
of Gitelman's take-out double, it wouldn't be unreasonable to
bid 6H.

{
If diamonds are 2-2 you make either 3NT or 6D if you guess clubs,
so if you had to choose between those two contracts you'd choose
the latter, of course. Otherwise, 5D is an excellent contract.
But Steiner wasn't given the choice once Lair opened with 3C.
Against 3NT, Moss hit on the right lead, so guessing clubs was
essential.

{
Advocates of sound opening bids would pass West's hand. If so,
it's possible that North/South buy the hand in 2S. Best defense
should beat it (two club ruffs), but a slip will let it through
- and all the while the hand belongs to East/West in 3D. But
once Lair opened the bidding, finding diamonds was easy. With
trumps 2-2 and king/queen of hearts in South, Lair couldn't be
denied ten tricks and he duly took them after losing the first
three. Minus 130. 20 IMPs to Lair/Steiner, who wins this round
with 106 IMPs.
