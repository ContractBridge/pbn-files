{
 An aggressive 2S raise by Zia spurred Eisenberg, with his good
distribution and hearts behind the heart bidder, to try for game
via a help-suit try of 3D.  Zia, of course, retreated to three
spades.

{
 A 20-HCP 2NT opening led to a normal three notrump via a Stayman
auction. Rodwell led the SJ from his broken sequence, carefully
avoiding blowing a trick. The four-one diamond split (the "wrong"
way) doomed the contract, but Eisenberg tried a valiant though
futile endplay in an effort to make. Eisenberg's throw-in would
have succeeded had East started with only three clubs and king-empty-fourth
of hearts. Alas, it was not to be: down two, minus 200, an unfortunate
-195 IMPs.

{
 Some Two-Over-One Game-Forcing pairs might reach three notrump
directly over North's one diamond, but Zia responded two clubs
and Eisenberg jumped to three notrump in an adaptation of "Fast
Arrival" that you'll seldom see from other pairs.
