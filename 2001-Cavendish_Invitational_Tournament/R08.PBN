{
Neither Piotr Gawrys nor Nickell considers his 11-point hand
worth an opening bid, so Amos Kaminski, a former winner of this
event, is left to open 1NT third in hand, after which a Stayman
auction gets him to 4S on the 4-4 fit. When Hamman leads a heart
and Nickell shows up with the ace/king there, it wouldn't be
too unreasonable to play Hamman for the SK, but Kaminski gets
both trumps and clubs right for a fairly normal, but nice-looking,
plus 620.

{
Twenty years ago, everbody had the same set of responses to Blackwood.
Nowadays, there are many different schemes. When Gawrys overcalls
Hamman's third-seat 3C opening and Nickell decides to raise,
fearing that would only help his opponents, Kaminski has the
chance to issue a cooperative slam try with a 4C cue-bid.

{
 After passing initially, Kaminski (steaming, perhaps) comes
in with a delayed takeout double even though he hold only three
cards in one of the two unbid suits. A lesser player than Gawrys
might skip several levels in diamonds but he is either trying
to steal from his opponents or catering to his partner's eccentricity
when he settles for a quiet 1NT. This has no effect on North/South's
bidding but you can judge for yourself whether it affected the
play.
