{
More Europeans coming in, this time Anton Maas/Vincent Ramondt,
well-known Dutch internationals. They were selected only yesterday
to play for their country in the European Championships next
month. Earlier this year, bridge players in Holland voted for
"best player in the country," and the winner was Maas. But at
the same time, the question was put to the experts, and then
Ramondt came out first. Let´s see how Weinstein and Levin fare
against these Dutch heroes. The Americans move to the E/W seats.

{
Here we see another example of the Levin/Weinstein Transfer Advances,
West's 3D showing at least a sound raise to 3H raise. Maas, still
hoping to compete effectively, doubled to show his diamonds,
but in practice that cost his side an overtrick when Ramondt
led the D7 (the king would have worked better, permitting a spade
switch). The low diamond lead allowed declarer to draw trumps,
ruff the diamonds, eliminate the clubs, and finally endplay North
by exiting with a small spade to the ten and king.

{
A natural, if somewhat curious, Dutch auction. If South´s 2NT
was indeed invitational it looks both a bit pessimistic (with
such good clubs) and presumptuous (with that heart holding),
but perhaps 2NT was a one-round force, at least semi-natural.
However, all went well for the Dutch. North had hearts stopped,
and he accepted the invitation (would he have without the CJ?).
