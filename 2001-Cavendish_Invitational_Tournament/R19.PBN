{
Ferraro probably didn앖 like the way the bidding went. Was it
Lawrence who recommended overcalling with South압 type of hand?
Anyway, Ferraro passed throughout. He led a diamond to his partner압
ace, and got his ruff. It seems futile to play a trump back now
as declarer압 high cards have to be in hearts, but Ferraro did.
Declarer continued with diamonds, throwing spades as South wouldn앖
(couldn앖) ruff. It was all over. Nothing could stop declarer
from getting four trump tricks, a spade ruff, two tricks in diamonds
and one in clubs.

{
Ferraro began with a shapely (but perhaps not so impressive in
high cards) 1H bid. Jansma bid a normal 1S, and then the tempo
changed. Duboin preempted with 3H, Verhees bid what he hoped
he might make. Ferraro, having little defense but still the shape
understandably thought that he should sacrifice. I wonder what
he would have done over 6C. But it was difficult for E/W to know
that 6C was on, the DK being well placed in spite of South opening.
