{
Another top encounter. The strong French partnership of Jean-Christophe
Quantin and Michel Abecassis, lying fifth after two sessions
will now face Claudio Nunes and Fulvio Fantoni, who are in second
place. Here, Nunes and Fantoni conduct an artificial sequence
to 2NT, and since Quantin had doubled a heart bid on the way,
Abecassis led the HJ, ducked.

{
North/South are cold for 3D, provided they don't lose a trump
trick to East, so even if Fantoni didn't make 3H, his sixth heart
was a good reason for taking the push - at least if you are a
believer in the Law of total tricks. The only downside was his
diamond queen, which on a bad day would mean that neither 3D
nor 3H would make (give West jack third, for instance).

[Contract "4C"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
With a combined double stopper in spades and the HK onside, East/West
are cold for 3NT, but they don't have the cards to bid it. And
when they neither have the distribution nor the trumps to even
consider 5C, stopping in a part-score is normal. Against 4C the
defenders have to lead trumps early, and when they duly do, Fantoni
only manages one heart ruff in dummy. Minus 130, and 23 IMPs
to Fantoni/Nunes.
