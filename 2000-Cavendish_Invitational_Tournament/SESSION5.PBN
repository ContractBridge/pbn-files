Effective preemption by Levin jockeyed Cohen into 3NT, with spades
unbid. Fortunately the clubs were declarer-proof, and when Levin
put in the CJ at trick one, Cohen cashed his top cards for all
13 tricks (when the DQ dropped).

{
Where North opens a natural 1C, East can bid diamonds twice and
buy the auction at the 2-level. 2D is touch-and-go, with the
defenders facing the uphill struggle of taking 3 trumps, a spade,
and two clubs. It's awkward for them to do this, so declarer
is a favorite. Cohen's catchall 1D caught Weinstein with no natural
2D overcall at his disposal; hence 3D, one down, -50. Decent
for Levin/Weinstein.

North was not tempted to overcall with 1S, but East's pass of
his partner's opener would not be the mainstream action anywhere
but France (E/W were Paul Chemla and Alain Levy). South's protective
double propelled North into 3S, a trifle high as the cards lie.
East led his partner's suit, where a diamond from his God-given
sequence might have been more effective. Declarer lost a spade,
a heart, and 2 club tricks (misguessing). A good 140 for the
Polish pair.

A very favorable lie for E/W, especially on a low spade lead
-- Chemla got a bit sloppy in the play, however, and held himself
to 8 tricks. In some of our discussions with American experts,
we have heard that hands with a 6-card major are one-bids, two-bids,
or three-bids. We have demurred, of course--take this North hand
to see why--even the legendary "passing is too dangerous" Wolffie
would not open this one.

The 1st round of bidding was normal. Subsequently, East bid one
club too many. This would have been singularly unsuccessful,
but West, Garner, adroitly removed to 3 diamonds. Lazard might
have doubled, but in this event he was right not to. He started
the SK and he and declarer played diamonds and spades in turn.
In the meantime, North was feeling pressured, and South had a
last chance to save the situation by shifting to a club after
winning his HA. When he exited passively with a heart, North
got squeezed in the black suits. A good 110 for the leaders.

When neither Garner nor Bramley opted for a marginal second-round
action, 2D bought the auction. Lazard led the C10 and Weinstein
could have gotten home by discarding a spade on the 3rd club
and playing a trump. Eventually he will discard a heart on a
long club and lose only 4 trump tricks. Here, he lost a spade,
a heart, and those 4 trumps for -100, a poor result for the leading
pair.

{
4S is a decent contract for E/W which only depends on the trump
break. However, South is unlikely to let them play with his strong
playing hand, and his likely 5C also fails by a trick. Academic!
Zia's weak 2 spades was doubled by South and he doubled again
when West's 3S came back to him. Billy Cohen decided to take
his chances. Where's the blame for this disaster? North might
have removed the 2nd double to 3NT, but at least 2 of the commentators
(EOK and SRK) lay the blame on South's door, feeling that he
should have preferred 4C at his second turn. A massive swing
for the Paki-American axis.

Although E/W can always make 6C from the East side and on a non-spade

Gitelman did not raise to 3H but Jacobs settled for 3C and that

There is no obvious 9th trick and 5D looks easier, but in practice,
East may return a spade if declarer ducks the first spade. An
auction like the one we projected (Gitelman refusing to "take"

9th trick. Good for the contending pair.

{
4H, the popular contract, can be made on the likely spade lead.
HA, club to K, club, win the trump switch with Ace, cash the
King, play to SK and ruff a spade to establish the 10, ruff the
third club, discard a diamond on the spade as East ruffs to get
endplayed!--making 5. East can discard on the S10, however, to
hold it to 10 tricks. Cheek-Miller stopped in 3H for +140 and
may gain if enough pairs fail in game.

Fleisher's weak notrump jockeyed Fallenius into 3H, where the
cards were not friendly--two down on the indicated spade lead,
starting the force. With rumors of an unlucky session "chez les
leaders" this deal may prove crucial to the stretch run of Rodwell-Fleisher.

Fleisher-Rodwell play a weakish NT so South was obligated to
open with 1D. The 1NT rebid showed 15-17, and after North had
shown game-going values with 5 hearts, South placed the final
contract. After a spade lead, ducked to the Ace, Rodwell accumulated
3 spades, 5 hearts, 2 diamonds and 1 club for 11 tricks.

{
The vulnerability dissuaded East from entering on the first round,
but he introduced his hearts after partner showed signs of life.
Chemla led a spade, ducked; and after declarer ran his 7 clubs
and cashed his HK, he could safely finesse the hearts for a second
overtrick. +460 to Garner-Weinstein, a result that figures to
be standard across the field.

{
Standard bidders might raise a 1H response to 2H but that is
not the French style. That leaves Levy with the choice between
1NT and 2C. Predictably, he tried 1NT, and Chemla closed out
the auction with 4H. Club lead, spade to the queen and king,
spade to the ace, low diamond. Chemla played HK, HJ, providing
the American supporters with a momentary cheap thrill...HA. +620.

{
Had East chosen to respond to West's 1D, N/S might have had their
work cut out to reach the good 3NT. The French, however, perhaps
uniquely, tend to maintain the integrity of their initial response.
Chemla played 3 rounds of spades, and on winning dummy's queen,
declarer played a club to the ace and led the queen of diamonds,
covered. A heart to the 10 then produced 10 tricks, a satisfactory
result on the last hand of the tournament for the worthy winners.
