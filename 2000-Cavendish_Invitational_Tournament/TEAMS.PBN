Hamman-Mahmood got to 2S, not being able to investigate for their

result was neutralized by Chagas-Helgemo's exuberant bidding
to 5C, for a loss of 3 IMPs.

{
The only point of interest is North's choice of opening bid in
fourth position. Wold opted for 1S where Chagas preferred a "practical"
4S. Opening 1S caters to the possibility, even opposite a passed
hand, of reaching a six diamond contract on a 4-4 or 5-4 fit
and using the spades for discards.

a Michaels Cue Bid. None of these actions would normally affect

double of 2H (not 2S) was a contributing factor.

If West raises 2S to 3S, N/S will probably let it play. 3S might
make on neutral defense and with declarer guessing clubs and
building a second heart trick. But it is not simple. Schiesses-Knap
did lead the club king, but versus 2S. The carding confused South,
who switched to the heart king allowing a ninth trick

Greco-Hampson did that after a 1NT opoening by North. He made

Knap-Schiesser also stopped safely, but on a slightly convoluted

lead but it proved safe enough and so gained an IMP.

{
East might try 1H over 1C to compete for the partscore (it's
clearly not for the lead!) and might get his side to 3H for +140.
If East passes, South is likely to respond 1S or a natural 2C,
getting N/S too high in 2NT or 3C. Reisig defended prettily against
Hampson's 2NT, after knocking out the heart ace. On the clubs
he threw two diamonds and two spades. Hampson exited in spades,
but Reisig put Garozzo in with the third heart for the vital
diamond switch - one down.Sure enough, Rodwell did come in with
1H, raised to 3H. Knap doubled for takeout but Schiesser passed
for penalty - cold for 530. With both four spades and a club
fit, that pass is fraught with danger.

Normal 1NT by south on a spade or club lead. Both of our Wests
led a spade to the Jack and Ace. South led the heart King to
the Ace. On this trick, Rodwell followed with the heart 6, which
looks like a negative Smith signal (upside down everything) about
spades. If so, Meckstroth did particularly well to switch to
the diamond queen, which Schiesser might have ducked. He took
it, however, and made only 5 tricks. Reisig followed low to the
first heart (Garozzo's Ace). Garozzo shifted to a club, took
the second heart and cashed clubs, then exited in hearts. Not
best here - plus 90. 5 IMPs to Meckwell.

shift to the king of hearts. West was able to ruff one club in

Meckstroth opened 3D while Garozzo passed. Imperfect preempts
seem to be the order of the day in the expert world, but Garozzo
has remained true to his principles. His pass led to a quiet

to double - down 500 and 8 IMPs to Schiesser. Grazie, Benito.

But in our match, Easts treated their hands as spades and extra
values (in different ways - Berkowitz' 1C was strong) +680 and
+650.The scoring method places huge emphasis on 1, 2, and 3-IMP
differences in the total match score, so overtricks can kill

Both Wests passed their marginal (Culbertson 2 1/2 honor tricks)
hand, but bid aggressively thereafter to reach the excellent
4S contract. South's takeout double is not particularly appealing
with his strength concentrated in the opponents' suit, but in
this event N/S were able to wriggle out of danger. No swing.

An example of how rarely power slams appear. Without a short

A routine 4S. In the closed room, Weinstein offered a splinter
after his partner's raise, but obviously North was not interested.
In the Open Room, South preferred to show his second suit. North
declined and South, who had slam visions, settled for game. Eleven
tricks were taken in both rooms, making judicious use of dummy's

North may not have an opening bid in the eyes of the world, but
Wold's 2D (majors? Or Multi?) put the lie to that. And in truth,
this bid jockeyed Berkowitz/Cohen into their normal, but unlucky
3NT. The spade lead blew a trick, but the defense was able to
develop clubs with the HK as an entry, -50. It's hard to find
fault with Seamon-Passell's auction which landed them in a 25-point
2NT. Club ten to the king. In refusing to set up a second club
for declarer, Weinstein gave him time for three heart tricks,
+120. 5 IMPs to Brachman..

underdog. Both Wests led the C6 to the A. Rodwell switched to

West took a chance by competing to 5H and got away with it, pushing
S to 5S after both Norths showed a sound S raise (artificially).
Best defense gets 3 clubs and the HA for 500. S bid 5S, as who
would not, and was not unhappy to see the SK guarded offside.

{
There are ten top tricks in 6S if only you can get at them, but
declarer has no fast entry to dummy. A heart lead, or a club
honor are the most troublesome.  Meckstroth led a diamond, however.
Helgemo won and made the winning play -- a low spade. Meckstroth
won and played the CQ, but that netted only 3 defensive tricks.
Good for The Dream Team. Same diamond lead versus Greco, who
played ace and another trump, a play that could easily have been
best. Zia encouraged a club switch. Three rounds of clubs left
Greco with a heart to lose. 10 IMPs.

An attenuated opening bid from North, Geoff Hampson, propelled
his side into 2NT. After the CK lead and a spade shift, declarer
led a heart to the jack, winning 8 tricks. In the other room,
E/W bought the contract in 3S. This could have been beaten 2
tricks as the play went, but South would have had to win the
2nd diamond with the queen to unblock, a slightly risky play
when he was sure of down one.

It's easy to imagine E/W getting to 5S, where they must guess
the SQ to make. Hampson's 1H led to a decision for Lev over 2H.
Fortunately, he had a natural 2NT available (if not, perhaps
pass is better than a responsive X--EOK). 4S, +650. Gawrys had
a 2-suited 2H at his disposal, which led Meckstroth to a slightly
different problem over 3H. He passed and was able to stay low.
4S made 6 on a heart lead and a diamond switch. 1IMP to Johnson.

{
A first glance at the North hand might not lead you to believe
that 3-level action was in order. Consider, then, the positions
of Gawrys (especially) and Hampson, who gambled that South's
likely spade shortage would accompany diamond length. Bingo.
An awesome "push" at N/S +110.

The bidding opened and closed with North's 1NT. Johnson -- a
fourth from the longest and strongest -- led the C2. This did
not wound declarer who, with the aid of 3 diamond tricks, wound
up with two overtricks. In the other room, East, Mansell, started
with an even less promising card, the D7. Reading the lead, declarer
was able to garner 4 diamond tricks, but fell from grace at the
end, taking the spade finesse when the defenders had set up enough
tricks to hold him to 1. 2 IMPs to Hansell.

{
Hampson had no real interest in competing to 3H, but Greco might
have been tempted to take a second bid. On AK of trumps and a
heart switch, all Lev's problems were eliminated; +140. The auction
had a different flavor at the other table, where Meckstroth started
with a strong 1C. Gawrys' 3H looks reckless to me (EOK) but he
got away with it; -50. 3IMPs to Mansell.

{
In one room, the Polish pair fetched up in a modest contract
at the one level, in a slightly inferior trump suit. 10 tricks
were made due to the favorable diamond lie. The other North,
Hampson, a devotee of the Meckstroth-Rodwell methods, opened
a light 1D. A competitive auction led N/S to 4S. When this got
doubled, South retreated to the haven of his more secure trump
suit. This, too, was doubled, but was cold. +550 and a gain of
9 IMPs.

{
Both E/Ws bid briskly to 3NT after North opened the bidding.
The respective Souths did well to lead a heart, and when North
inserted the 9, declarer was headed for defeat. However, at both
tables, curiously enough, North did NOT cover the jack of clubs,
and declarer was able to take 3 club tricks, 5 diamonds and the
HA. Perhaps the Norths were playing declarer for AQ109 of clubs.
One can sympathize, but not necessarily approve, particularly
in the room where East had bid only 1D over 1C.

There are no sensible misguesses available to West in 4S. In
actual play, both Gawrys and Hampson led their red aces, then
their black one. The trick for E/W was to avoid slam -- not a
tall order on these cards. Hampson's double did not turn the
CA into a trick, so he was -990, where Gawrys was -650. 8 IMPs
