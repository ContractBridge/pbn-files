{
OR - Zhou Qinghong, West, began proceedings with a Precision
club on the prime 23-count. Liu Haitao, East, responded 1S showing
five plus spades, and, in this case, 8-11 HCP. Zhou decided to
set trumps early on with a raise to 2S. Now, E/W bid their values,
and Liu got the general nature of his hand across with a 3NT
bid. Since Janice Molson, North, didn't overcall diamonds, Tobi
Sokolow, South, chose the C7 (rather than the D8) as her opening
lead. Declarer lost the major-suit kings for eleven tricks. Plus
460 for E/W.

{
CR - Mark Molson, West, also had the big club weapon in his bag.
Juanita Chambers, East, began identically with a 1S response,
but now the paths diverged. Molson announced his heart suit before
offering support for spades. In a far more aggressive state of
mind than his counterpart in the Open Room, Molson used RKCB,
and found one keycard missing. 5D requested the SQ, and Chambers
admitted to it with a leap to 6S. A very poor contract, as it
requires the heart finesse and a spade guess (if there is one),
6S nevertheless came home. A fortunate 11 IMPs to Wei.

{
OR - East used a Michaels Cue-bid, and South implied a willingness
to penalize with her double. North's 3S bid clearly asked for
a spade stopper for 3NT (solid diamonds), and South complied
with 3NT, a distinct underbid with the enormous potential of
that South hand. However, North came to the rescue when she moved
over 3NT with 4D. South, perhaps still worried about her diamond
support, subsided in 4NT. [DC] On the lead of the H10 declarer
took all the tricks with the aid of the spade finesse. A very
unsatisfying plus 520 for N/S.

CR - What a difference in evaluation from Sun Shaolin, South,
of the Chinese Open team! After an identical start, Sun simply
jumped to 6NT over Li Xin's 3S bid. He knew what to expect from
the 3S advance. The eighth diamond is the extra gem that makes
this a good grand slam. The bidding would have gone the same
way if North held only seven diamonds. A difficult grand to bid,
and in this scenario would have netted only 3 more IMPs. The
S7 lead settled the hand in quick fashion. Plus 1020 for N/S,
and 11 IMPs to the China Open team.

OR - South's 2C bid was three-card Drury-fit. Thereafter, a natural
auction propelled N/S into 4S. East led the DA (when a trump
would have been better), but then did the best he could by shifting
to the S4. A further trump was led by West when in with the CA.
Declarer tried to ruff out the diamonds, and when that didn't
work, fell back on the heart finesse. West was pleased to win
the doubleton HQ, and cashed two high clubs to defeat the contract
two tricks. An excellent plus 200 for E/W.

CR - N/S also used Drury to reach 4S, North choosing an uninformative
sequence, deciding not to explore a perfect fit slam with a natural
3C. East led the DA, and the S3 shift got the defense back on
track. Li Xin followed a line of play similar to Janice Molson's
- to a point. With all the trumps gone, declarer played a heart
to the king, and discarded his club loser on a diamond, giving
East his DK. On the forced heart return, declarer guessed correctly
putting in the nine for a pretty plus 620, and 13 IMPs to China

OR - N/S had suffered some earlier setbacks in this match, so
that might explain the Multi 2D bid with the North hand. Whatever
the reason, Janice Molson scored a goal with her effort. Tobi
Sokolow's pass-or-correct 2S bid caught Zhou Qinghong with a
minimum strong notrump and it is easy to see why he passed. When
2S slipped past Zhou and Liu did not protect, their "normal"
3NT went begging. The defense got off to a good start with the
C4 lead, but Liu failed to continue clubs, and declarer escaped
for one down. Only minus 50 for N/S.

{
CR - N/S in this room never seriously contemplated taking any
action with their cards, and E/W had a free run to 3NT. The S6
lead went to the jack and queen. Mark Molson successfully handled
clubs for five tricks, hoping that if he lost a trick to North
it would be more difficult to find an effective switch to hearts
(this is the dangerous heart layout for declarer) and had eleven
tricks when North blanked his HK, and South had to yield a trick
to the H10 late in the day. Plus 460, and 11 IMPs to Kathie Wei's
team, who really needed them.

[Board "18|it|OR - An evaluation problem for West. Would you bid 3NT after partner's non-vulnerable 3C preempt? Zhou did, and had no problem scoring up his game when North attacked with the DK, rather than a spade or the killing H8. Quite an impossible lead for North to find. The lucky layout in hearts (as well as no ace-third of clubs for the defense) provided declarer with nine tricks. Oh yes, thank you for the ten third of diamonds partner! A wonderful plus 400 for E/W. Would you overcall 3H with the South cards?"]

CR - Mark Molson was under no illusions about partner's 3C bid,
and passed. Li Xin balanced with 3S (a smile from Molson), and
Sun Shaolin raised to 4S (a broad grin from Molson). Christmas
had come early, he thought, and he was pleased to double. The
CK was taken by dummy's ace, and the S5 played to declarer's
eight. Declarer went about his business, and held his losses
to three trump tricks and the DA. Not quite Christmas, Mark.
Down only one. Plus 200 for N/S, and 5 IMPs to the Chinese Open
team. The home team started with a well-deserved victory.
