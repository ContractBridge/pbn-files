{
OR - A natural auction to a perfectly sound 2S contract opened
the fourth quarter. Jason bid notrump, rather than raise to 2S
because of the balanced nature of his hand. There are a combined
24 HCP between the two hands, and a source of tricks, but 3NT
is a relatively poor contract. Declarer lost the obvious four
tricks, and soon had plus 140 on his scorecard. Would the Chinese
Women push to the 3NT game?

[Declarer "W"]
{
CR - The answer is yes, and why not, when trailing by 57 IMPs?
 West made a constructive 2S raise, and East made a natural 3D
game-try. West took her chances with a 3NT continuation. The
H5 lead turned out to be very successful when South could play
king, ace, and another heart setting up North's HJ. The defense
had the time for three hearts, one diamond, and one club for
down one: minus 50. 5 IMPs to Mavromichalis. 3NT might have been
more interesting on the lead of the CJ, but it is likely that
the defenders would have sorted out that suit and beaten the
contract.

{
OR - Given the state of the match, it was normal for Ling Gu
to drive to 3NT over her partner's medium-range notrump. China
needed some good fortune if they were to have any chance. The
HQ lead went to declarer's ace, and Yalan Zhang crossed to the
SA to take the losing club finesse. Hoping for lightning to strike,
China had to settle for thunder. Jason, with a shrewd idea about
declarer's high cards, found the brilliant shift to the D10!
The defense had one spade, five diamonds, and one club for down
three: minus 300.

CR - Helgemo-Lair, in contrast, were content to bid soundly and
finished in a good 3C contract. Declarer timed the hand nicely,
and when East couldn't over-ruff dummy's C7, declarer played
a club to the ace in the middle game. The red suits were stripped
out, and when West was on play with the CK, he had to break spades
for declarer, thus sparing him any guesswork. Nine tricks: plus
110. 9 IMPs to Mavromichalis, who now led, 157 to 85. A 72-IMP
lead with six boards remaining settled any comeback hopes for
the Chinese Women's team.

{
OR - The North hand is a difficult one to bid with any certainty,
the more so after Jason's featherweight 1S opening. Ling Gu's
4H overcall, with the broken diamond suit as a kicker, would
be a popular expert choice. When South doubled, North passed.
Besides, these Hackett boys would probably defend 5H doubled
with: D7 to DA, D2 ruffed, C4 to CJ, D6 ruffed - 500! After two
hearts and a diamond shift, declarer can make 4S if he crosses
to a club, and runs a high spade. When he ruffed the D2, however,the
S7 came into its own. Down one: minus 100.

{
CR - Despite South's negative double, E/W arrived in 4S. On the
auction, declarer would be a favorite to make 4S doubled, and
North guessed to remove to 5H. The spotlight shifted to the E/W
pair now. Would they find the double dummy defense for plus 500,
and 12 IMPs? Hong Li Wang led two high clubs, and declarer had
a huge 850 in his plus column. 13 IMPs to Mavromichalis, when
it could have been 7 or 12 IMPs the other way. With one board
remaining, Mavromichalis led by the overwhelming score of: 177
to 88.

{
OR - The Hackett twins conducted a very pretty sequence to slam
on the last board of the match. Here is what it meant: 1NT =
weak, 2D = transfer to hearts (several hand types), 2NT = super-accept
in hearts, 3D = re-transfer to hearts, 3H = compliance, 3S/4C/4D
= cue-bids, 4NT = RKCB, 5D = one or four keycards, 5NT = grand
slam try, asking for specific kings with the understanding that
all five keycards, and the trump queen are accounted for, 6H
= no side kings. Would Jason locate the DQ to make his slam?
No, North did, the lead was the D3: plus 1430 for E/W.

{
CR - East's 2NT bid was a forcing raise, and West's 3C announced
a balanced minimum. East's thoughts of slam were dealt a blow,
and she settled for the 4H game. E/W were playing Precision,
so the West hand may have been worse than it was. Declarer misguessed
the DQ for eleven tricks, and plus 650 for E/W. Another 13 IMPs
to Mavromichalis to end an awesome display of power. Final Score:
Mavromichalis 190 - China Women 88. Congratulations to the multi-national
Mavromichalis team on their fine victory in the 2000 China Cup.
