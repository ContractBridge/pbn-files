{
OR - I  suspect that 1S would be the popular choice today with
5-5 in the black suits. Morris Chang's 1S caught Yu Zhang with
a hand slightly too strong for 2H in her style, so she tried
a two-step approach and was able to bid a peaceful 2H on the
way out, Chang passing Bobby Wolff's nonforcing 2D call, momentarily
missing the club fit that has 11 winners. Wolff was able to show
his clubs without overstating his values and now North's choices
were to pass 5C and go minus 600 or to save in 5H for minus 500.
North made the right decision, losing the four obvious tricks.

{
CR - Ming Sun, playing a strong club system. had no choice but
to open 1S. Here CH Kuo preferred a less complicated approach
and settled for a 2H overcall. Hong Li Wang was dealt a perfect
negative double, and used it. When Patrick Huang raised to 4H
(contrast with the normally aggressive Wenfei Wang's gentle 3H
in the Open Room facing a known strong hand), West inexplicably
passed. What would she need to bid 5C, one wonders? [DC] So,
Kuo was left to play in an untroubled 4S. This lost the same
four tricks for down one. Minus 100: a somewhat peculiar 9-IMP
swing.

{
OR - A weak jump overcall of 3C is hardly automatic for West.
Chang risked it in part because South's Precision 1D wasn't well
defined. North rejected a negative double because she feared
a leave-in. Here, however, South suppressed her four-card spade
suit because if 3NT were the right contract, 3S would usually
preclude reaching it. Now the spade fit was buried and 5D was
reached in due course. The S10 lead solved some of declarer's
problems. When she played the H4, East, fearing a singleton HJ,
rose ace and gave his partner a ruff. N/S plus 400.

CR - In this room, Hong Li Wang opened the East hand (contrast
with Wolff's somewhat surprising pass) with a weak notrump in
first chair, silencing South. When E/W came to rest in 3C on
a transfer sequence, the auction had come up perfectly for Kuo,
who reopened with a takeout double, converted to penalties by
Huang. On the lead of the H10 to the jack, queen and ace, the
defense had seven fairly easy tricks for down three. N/S plus
500: 3 IMPs to the Wolff team.

OR - It must have been tempting for North to compete to 3S over
West's 3H but with a balanced hand and the likelihood that the
DK would be offside, she resisted. Against 4H Yu she led the
SA, followed by the DA, and a spade to South's queen. The D6
return amazingly (DC) collected the jack, queen and king. All
of a sudden, the seemingly cold game had been defeated. The D10
was the setting trick. 4H, down one: plus 50 for N/S.

{
CR - After an identical start to the auction, Ming Sun preferred
to make a responsive double rather than bid 3H. With two places
to play, the double might find a safer partscore in clubs on
some occasions. Kuo led the SA, and followed with the S6 to Huang's
queen. The remarkable opportunity to create magic in the diamond
suit disappeared when Huang switched to a club. Declarer stripped
the hand down to a heart and three diamonds in his hand and dummy,
then played a diamond towards the king. North was without resource,
and declarer had her ten tricks.

OR - Over Wolff's natural 1C, Wenfei Wang showed both red suits
 with 2NT. Chang's 3H bid was artificial, showing spades. Yu
Zhang doubled, giving Wolff the opportunity to compete accurately
with 3S. This silenced Wenfei, and Chang raised to 4S. N/S quietly
passed this out, when one or the other should have been competing
more vigorously [DC]. A thoughtful H3 lead from South collected
the club ruff, but South played a heart when North followed to
the ace with the jack, the systemically correct card from the
remaining J2.

CR - Over East's Precision 2C, Huang intervened with a leap to
3H (that looks odd but it seems certain that Huang was operating
on his own here). Spades and hearts were bid and raised to the
five level, and West might have had her suspicions about the
auction when Huang volunteered 5H at adverse vulnerability. It
was difficult for her to sacrifice with a balanced hand and reasonable
defense but the board had already been lost at the other table.
Kuo's red suits were just what Dr Huang had ordered, and when
the diamonds broke two-two, declarer had eleven tricks.
