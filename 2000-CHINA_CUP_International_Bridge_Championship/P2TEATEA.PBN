{
Our featured pair for the second session are the Hackett twins
from England, Justin and Jason. Haichang Bao, South, began proceedings
with a Precision 1C, and Jian Wang, North, responded 1NT showing
a balanced 8-13 HCP. Though 2C appears natural by South, it was,
in effect, an artificial checkback. The spade fit was uncovered,
and North cue-bid his HA. This was good news to South, who decided
that 6C would have some play now. If he could hold his black-suit
losers to one, he felt that 6C would offer more safety as a trump
suit.

{
When Justin rebid 1NT, ostensibly showing a balanced 15-17 HCP,
he may have had some qualms about the accuracy of the bid. There
were any number of flaws in this endeavour. He had a singleton
spade (albeit an honor), he had no diamond stopper, he had a
two-suiter, and he held in excess of his promised point-count
total. When Jason forced with 3S, Justin had to continue with
3NT, as all four-level bids would be cue-bids in support of spades.

{
Hongjun Xu, West, offered partner, Zejun Zhuang, a choice of
games with his leap to 3NT. This was a wise move, and was a considerably
better contract than 4H. Both hands were balanced, and all suits
had multiple stoppers, so the nine-trick game had more appeal
than the ten-trick heart game. Justin's S5 lead went to the nine
and king. West broached the heart suit by leading the H3 to the
ten, jack, and king. An absolute must for those in a 4H game
in an effort to snuff out a third heart trick in the South hand.

Justin opened 1H on his "swan", and after Jason's 2D bid, emphasized
his quality hearts with a jump to 3H, rather than reverse with
a 2S bid. Jason bided his time with 4C cue-bid now as slam was
definitely in the picture. Sun Ming, North, doubled the club
cue-bid with her suitable holding, and when this came back to
Jason, he redoubled guaranteeing first round control. Justin
took charge now with RKCB, and on finding two keycards without
the HQ, he jumped to slam, confident in his ability to locate
the missing trump queen.

Jason's 2D opening announced a hand with both majors and less
than an opening bid. Sun Ming, North, made a card-showing double,
and Justin passed to show equal length in the majors. Wang Hongli,
South, waited for more information with her minor two-suiter,
and passed. Jason's redouble asked Justin to pick his better
major (it also implied five-five in the majors, as with 5-4 he
would simply bid the five-card suit). Justin chose spades, and
again South waited for clarification with a pass. North made
a penalty double, or so she thought.

After Justin's 1H opening bid, Jason began by showing his source
of tricks in clubs, rather than make some sort of heart raise.
The 2C bid is a far more descriptive move than any heart raise
at this juncture. Jason, with his useful hand, decided to bide
his time with a waiting 2D bid on AK6. Jason's 4D bid was meant
as a splinter in support of hearts (but how can that be, when
he hasn't mentioned any heart support to this point? [DC]). Justin
expected at least ten minor-suit cards for this action, and used
RKCB for diamonds.

Geir Helgemo, South, opened a rather heavy 4H (for him anyway)
in first seat. This may have had something to do with the previous
result (see Board 18). This achieved the desired set of circumstances
when Justin balanced with 5D on the East cards. The two-card
disparity in the minors was the deciding factor for advancing
with 5D, rather than a two-suited takeout bid of 4NT. Helgemo
doubled this to show a surprise for the opposition.

{
The auction started along a natural vein with 2NT showing a balanced
8-19 HCP. Jason's 3S bid attracted 4C from Justin. This announced
a cue-bid in clubs (aces and kings are cue-bid according to agreement),
and a maximum with four-card spade support. Jason, well within
the slam zone, brought out RKCB, and upon hearing about the two
keycards and the trump queen (5S), bid the slam. If Wang Wenfei
had laid down her CA on opening lead, the Hacketts would have
produced a marvelous plus 980. The two diamonds would be pitched
on dummy's high hearts.

{
Shi Yan, South, opened a Precision 1C, and Jason interfered with
a "CRASH" 1NT overcall showing two suits of the same shape. In
this case, the rounded suits (hearts and clubs). Guoxu Zhang,
North, passed for the moment, as he had no positive call to make
on his five-count. Justin, upped the ante to 3NT, as a blocking
move on the 1C bidder, but also as a request for partner to bid
4C with the rounded suits, or 4D with the pointed suits. This
got by South, and Jason removed to 4C.
