{
OR - Holding a near maximum and solid major suit values, Jackson,
North, chose to try 3NT when Klar, South, showed clubs, non-forcing,
over Hellemann's major two-suiter (well, sort of) overcall. Following
a heart lead, declarer knocked out the spade Ace, after which
the defense cashed out for down 1, taking two tricks in each
red suit and the SA. Notice that even if the club suit had broken
3-3, the contract would have had no chance. Down 1 for minus
50 to NS.

{
CR - After opening the bidding with a 4-card major 1H (1NT would
have been 11-13), Rauscheid, North judged well to pass her partner's
minimum 1NT response. Nehmert, South, won the opening club lead
with the Ace and knocked out the spade Ace. The helpful diamond
return allowed her to establish 2 diamond tricks, and when East
had to give her a heart trick in the endgame, she ended up with
an overtrick, losing only 2 diamonds, 2 spades and 1 heart trick;
minus 120 and 5 imps to Europe.

[Contract "3D"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
OR - The play in 3D was straightforward. Hellemann, East, lost
the 4 obvious tricks to make her contract with ease. In the auction,
the European East-West passed up an opportunity for a substantial
set when they failed to double the North Americans' 2H bid, which
was in response to a balancing double on slender values after
West had shown maximum values with her redouble. On the lie of
the cards, this would have yielded 500 points rather than the
modest 110. But then, it was early in an imp-match.

{
CR - The same opportunity for a 500-point set in 2H arose at
this table also. However, here it was Habert, East, who had found
a redouble. Kraft, West, holding a maximum herself, might well
have pounced on South's 2H-bid, but she was probably deterred
by her 3-card diamond holding, the suit her partner had rebid
to show extra length. The opening lead of the diamond Jack against
3D was the same as in the open room, and the defense took the
same 4 tricks; plus 110 to EW and no swing.

OR - When Jackson, North, responded 1H to South's light 1C opening
bid, East who held the best hand at the table was silenced. Holding
the best hand proved to be a liabilty in the defense against
the thin NS notrump game. Following a diamond lead, East was
put under severe pressure on the run of the clubs after declarer
had scored a trick in each major. She had to discard a heart
winner and her diamond exit card. She was next thrown in with
a diamond and had to give away the rest of the spade suit. Well
played by Klar; plus 400 to NS.

[Declarer "N"]
{
CR - At first glance it would seem that 2H should go down, but
as in the open room, East was at a positional disadvantage. After
ruffing a club and pulling trumps, she had to give up a diamond
trick (playing another spade would not have helped, for South
ducks). Nor would it have done East any good to rise with the
spade King at trick 6. With declarer having too many black-suit
winners, and the diamond Queen protected, East is helpless. In
the end, she took 4 trump tricks and a spade trick to hold declarer
to her contract; 2 imps to Europe.

[Declarer "W"]
{
OR - The EW auction was quite conservative, coming to rest in
1S. However, had East, Hellemann, elected to rebid 1NT, EW would
have stopped in 2S. Declarer, Malinowski, could have made 2 overticks,
but fearing a diamond overruff by North, she chose to discard
- first a club, then a heart - on the third and fourth rounds
of diamonds. Thus, she comfortably made one overtrick. If the
defense had aimed to prevent heart ruffs by leading trumps, Malinowski
could have established at least one club trick. Plus 110 to EW.

OR - Holding good defensive values in the red suits, Hellemann,
East, only raised pre-emptively to 3S over North's negative double,
despite the favorable vulnerability. She must have been delighted
when NS bid to 4H anyway. The lead of the SA, ruffed by South,
proved somewhat of a 'Greek gift'. Declarer could not handle
the bad trump split and although very careful play (playing on
clubs) might still have seen her home, she was destined to go
down once she cashed her second high trump; minus 100 for NS.

received a spade lead and discarded a diamond to preserve entries,
as she was planning to establish the clubs. West declined to
win the second round of clubs - necessary to beat the contract
- which forced East to ruff with a likely natural trump trick.
This improved dummy's trump position and declarer ended up with
10 tricks; plus 620 to NS and 12 imps to Europe.

lead, declarer played a diamond, and again a diamond after crossing

{
OR - The somewhat unfortunate trump division gave declarer no
chance at all in 5C. Even a major suit lead, while seemingly
helpful, still does not allow declarer to eliminate her side
suit losers. Incidentally, the optimal play in trumps is finessing
the Jack if West follows with a low club on the first round.
Notice that 4H would not have fared any better, as that contract
can be set in several ways, with or without a club ruff; minus
100.

[Declarer "N"]
{
CR - Indeed, 4H was reached at this table, and it went down in
short order when the defenders scored a club ruff. After the
intial diamond lead and spade shift, declarer had no chance left
anyway, even if declarer could have drawn trumps. The bidding
at both tables was just too optimistic, with both the North and
South players probably giving undue weight to their singleton
diamond. Down 1 for minus 100 and no swing.

[Contract "2H"]
[Declarer "S"]
{
OR - 2H was a cosy contract, and declarer easily made 2 overtricks
once the defenders failed to find their diamond ruff. An EW contract
of 2C might have gone down several tricks with good defense and
declarer misguessing the heart position. 2S would normally go
down only 1 trick, however (unless the defense finds the club
ruff by South for down 2), and that contract might well be reached
had 2C been doubled. +170 to NS.

break and the opposing spade honors offside. At least, the club
Ace was well placed, preventing the defense from obtaining a
trump promotion with a fourth round of spades; plus 110 to EW.

[Vulnerable "NS"]
[Contract "3NT"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
CR - East was perhaps a little pushy trying for this non-vulnerable
game, but with quite a bit to spare, West was certainly justified
in accepting the invitation. Actually, the contract largely depended
on dropping the H9 within three rounds. Alas, it was not to be,
and 3NT simply hobbled 2 down; plus 100 and 5 imps to Europe,
now ahead 29-1. Because of the nature of this match, each NS
pair was comparing with BOTH EW pairs, and the totals were added.
The score you see here is only for these 2 tables and might not
reflect the actual match score.
