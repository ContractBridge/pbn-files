{
OR - With your high card points distributed 21 opposite 3, it
seldom pays to bid a tough 3NT, but with West's hearts looking
almost as ace-king-queen fourth, you're entitled to be an optimist.
And with France down 36-2, you could expect them to be there.
But no. After the H9 lead to the ten, West led the DQ, hoping
for a stiff jack, and got the S10 back. Now he was in trouble,
and on a bad day even 2NT would have been too high. But with
spades 3-3, he could duck and later endplay South for nine tricks.
+150 EW.

CR - At this table East raised to 3NT, hoping one of his suits
would provide tricks or his intermediates would be useful. After
the same heart lead, West got off with a low diamond, ducked
the spade return, won the club shift (another spade would have
been better) and played another low diamond. What's the problem?
Ten tricks; +630 EW and another 10 IMPs to USA, extending their
lead.

OR - North opened with a strong club and learned that South had
less than 8 HCPs (1D) and didn't like any of his suits. So he
simply called it a day over 3C instead of persisting with 3D.
A trump lead through South leads to at least two down, but after
two rounds of spades, the DQ to the ace and a third spade, North
was in good shape and would have made his contract if he had
led a fourth diamond instead of the second heart. Now the heart
split meant one down; +50 EW

ruffs, but this time it just destroyed East's spade holding.

{
CR - East's bidding in the closed room looks a little timid,
but it would have been OK if he had been alert at trick two.
What he has to do is win North's H8 with the HA and shift to
his diamond. But that was hardly obvious, and when he followed
the book advice of "second hand low" West's entry to the diamond
tricks was gone. Nicely played by North, who deserved to win
the board. +420 NS meant 6 IMPs to France.

OR - One club showed 16+ HCP and the rest of the auction was
artificial. NS avoided the 50% six diamonds and safely came to
rest in 3NT. East led a spade and declarer stuck in the queen
for the overtrick. When a club to the king lost to the ace he
settled for ten tricks.

{
CR - In the French system the range for a 1NT opening is 15-18,
so South was not tempted to open one diamond. West led a heart
and declarer soon tried a club to the king. When that lost it
was no longer safe to take the spade finesse (you could lose
four clubs and a spade), so declarer settled for nine tricks.

{
OR - If there is a hint of a game out there, then Meckstroth
and Rodwell are going to have a sniff at it. Note the aggressive
nature of Rodwell's 1D overcall on the 4-card suit. Not to mention
the jump raise to 3S! How could they miss game after this start?
The club ace and king were cashed before East shifted to a trump.
Declarer won in hand to play a trump to the ace, a heart to the
ace, and a heart ruff. A club was ruffed, and declarer claimed
11 tricks. +450 to NS.

{
CR - Here, South didn't venture in with a 1D overcal. When he
remained silent the first time around, there wasn't much chance
that partner could visualize the perfect fit, even with the redouble
and the 3H cue-bid. A lot of delayed action brought the partnership
to rest in 3S. The CA was led, followed by a trump shift. Declarer
played ace of hearts, and a club toward dummy. East took his
king, but that was all for the defence. +200 to NS, and 6 imps
to the USA. The match ended in a USA white-wash of France, 101
to 8 imps!
