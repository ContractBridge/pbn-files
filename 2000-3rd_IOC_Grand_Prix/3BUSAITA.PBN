{
OR - Rodwell's 2NT was a limit raise or better in hearts, and
North thought enough of his sixth heart to go straight to game.
Lauria got off to the best lead, a club, and when Versace gained
the lead in hearts, he cashed one high club and returned a diamond.
That should have been enough for one down, but when West later
covered the S7 with the S10 (no good), Meckstroth could develop
a second spade trick. A miracle! Plus 620.

{
CR - Duboin's artificial 2D response was at least a constructive
heart raise (9+ with 3+ hearts) and Soloway's double was takeout
of hearts. Bocchi took a shot at 4H here, too, and was rewarded
when Hamman chose a bad moment to be active. To be perfectly
fair, Hamman figured to hold at least one honor in diamonds for
his takeout double. Less spectacular, perhaps, but another great
plus 620 and a flat board. [AW]

{
OR - An enterprising takeout double from Meckstroth was quickly
brushed aside by East. Rodwell had a notion that 5H might not
be expensive, but with a singleton to lead against 4S, there
was a lively chance to beat the enemy game. Rodwell got his diamond
ruff and switched to a heart, but there was nothing more to the
play; the losing club finesse held Lauria to ten tricks; plus
420. So, 5H (down only 300) would have been a good sacrifice,
but that would have been quite a gamble from South. A normal
result.

and led a trump. SA and a second club threatened a trump promotion.

high (if East discards DQ, declarer exits a trump; if East keeps

forever. East's 1H overcall caught South with a good hand and
long hearts, so he bided his time with a pass, but came alive
with a redouble over East's competitive double. Rodwell gave
his partner plenty of leeway by settling for 4D, and after SA

showed a strong invitational raise in hearts and East doubled
to tell his partner that their side had the majority of the strength.
Versace was not able to benefit from that knowledge, however,

it dangerous for Duboin to compete to 3H. After the spade against
3D, North shifted to his singleton club in the hope of obtaining
a ruff. This only succeeded in speeding up the play. Declarer
soon claimed ten tricks for a 7-IMP gain to USA.

Lauria's 5D over 4H looks strange, but it was the right thing
to do here, as 4H happens to make (after two rounds of spades
and two rounds of diamonds, South needs the HK to be singleton
and the CK with West). 5D needed only the CA onside (or a club
lead), but it neither was likely on the auction, so Versace finished
one down: minus 100.

{
OR - Meckstroth's double showed hearts, which explains Rodwell's
4H over 4D. A void in the opponents' suit is a big asset, but
still it feels wrong to act with such bad hearts. North could
count on South to have at least one ace and no diamonds, but
when he didn't hold the fourth trump he rated to have, 6H was
simply too high, although it was not without play at single dsummy.
When East could ruff the CK, he cashed the HA and a diamond trick
for two down: minus 100.

{
CR - When East didn't open, North-South had an easy route to
4H, their best contract. On a club lead, North might well have
gone down, but when East led the DK, hoping to create a force,
North had an easy time. He ruffed and led a heart to his hand,
creating a dilemma for East. If he wins the trick, he can't both
remove dummy's entry to the spades and stop a second diamond
ruff; and if ducks, a second diamond ruff is declarer's tenth
trick. Plus 420: 11 IMPs to Italy. So much for not leading a
singleton with four trumps!

OR - The Italian pair stopped safely at a low level, East bidding
a slightly conservative 1NT at his second turn. In the play North
shifted to a spade when in with the HQ. This did not paralyze
declarer, as the late Ron Andersen was accustomed to saying before
a packed Vugraph theatre. Lauria ended up with nine tricks for
a score of plus 150.

CR - Hamman-Soloway play a strong club with four-card majors;
hence the 1S opening bid. 1NT could be up to 11 HCP, but was
not forcing. Here declarer tackled spades himself, so he lost
two tricks in the suit. Plus 120, but 1 IMP to Italy.

{
OR - Lauria's 3H bid was invitational and natural. Meckstroth
and Rodwell weren't stopping short of this game, and were quickly
in 4S. Lauria, thinking he had some defense, applied the axe.
He cashed his two high clubs, and shifted to a heart, Versace
winning the jack. Meckstroth ruffed the second heart, and virtually
certain the SK was on his right for the opening bid, played the
SQ to the ace, felling the singleton king offside: plus 590.

{
CR - Bocchi stretched to introduce his spades over Soloway's
limited 2C, and Hamman's double was negative. NS quickly arrived
in game here, and the CK was advanced. East's switch D3 went
to declarer's queen, and with less to guide him than Meckstroth
had in the other room (where both clubs were cashed), Bocchi
played the SQ to the ace. Great was the fall thereon. A nice
plus 420 to hold the Italian loss on the board to 5 IMPs, but,
more importantly, saving the match. If Bocchi had gone down one,
USA would have won the match 59-58! Making 4S meant a victory
to Italy, 58-52.
