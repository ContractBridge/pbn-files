{
OR - A simple sequence to a normal contract. Because of Lasut's
initial pass and because E/W were vulnerable, Manoppo went quietly
in the pass-out seat, but I suspect he would have taken another
view in a slightly different situation. An unlikely spade lead
would hold 2H to eight tricks, but when Manoppo led the DK, Versace
had time to draw trumps and build a diamond trick for a spade
discard. Three made: plus 140. [AW]

{
CR - Down 11 IMPs with 12 boards to go, Duboin was reluctant
to hold back when there might be 6 IMPs on the line, despite
the warning signs. A more subtle danger in 2NT (minor suit takeout)
is that partner will respond 3C with three-three (or two-two!)
in the minors - and that is exactly what happened. All suits
split, and nobody doubled, but it was still two down: minus 200,
2 IMPs to Indonesia, 102-89. If you want to balance with this
West hand, the best way is to double, and then remove 2S to 2NT.
East should in that case prefer diamonds with equal minor suit
lengths. [AW]

2H((4S/5H or 4414 or 4405) so Lasut would not hold four spades
unless he held at least six hearts. N/S found each other in clubs,
but neither player had much reason to save over 4H. There was
nothing to the play, declarer losing a club, a diamond and a

CR - Duboin had to start with 2C (an 11+ relay) as 1S (like a
forcing notrump) would have shown a limited hand while 1NT would
have shown 5+ spades. Bocchi's 2H showed 5+H/4S and a minimum
and two more relays conformed 4-6-2-1 with 11-13 HCP. Duboin
gave up but not comfortably. With North on lead declarer was
bound to take eleven tricks, the diamond loser going away on
East's hearts. Therefore, Sacul's diamond lead didn't matter.
Plus 450, and 1 IMP to Italy, 90-102.

{
OR - A good Precision auction to the best contract on this tricky
combination. The natural investigation convinced West that the
club stopper in notrump was tenuous, at best. A club lead (ducked)
might defeat 3NT as the H10 does not fall doubleton or tripleton,
but declarer could make it by winning the CQ, and taking (say)
the diamond finesse, then testing hearts, and (finally) running
the SQ. In 4H, after two rounds of clubs, declarer played ace-jack
of hearts, then ace-jack of spades. Versace won and switched
to a diamond. Lasut managed an overtrick the elegant way by finessing
the DQ, overtaking the S10, and squeezing South in spades and
diamonds on the fifth heart: plus 450.

showed either 19+ with at least six diamonds or a couple of strong
types with primary heart support. 3C was a relay and 3NT showed
diamonds with black suit stoppers. Sacul chose for his opening
lead .... the H6. Declarer won in hand, and played the SJ to
South's king. The C10 was taken by North's ace for a spade back.
Declarer could take the diamond finesse now for ten tricks: plus
430. That was 1 IMP to Indonesia when it might well have been

OR - E/W have a great club fit, and if they can get East to be
declarer, 6C is cold (and a pretty good contract, as well). But
clubs were never bid in a natural sense. 1C was Precision (16+),
and when Manoppo bid 3S over Versace's preemptive overcall, Lasut
chose a practical 3NT rather than look for a minor-suit fit.
Had Versace led a black card or the DQ, the contract would probably
have been defeated, but when he put his faith in his long suit,
Lasut soon claimed nine tricks: plus 600.

re-opened with 3NT, got the same (bad?) heart lead as in the
Open Room, and took the same nine tricks. Plus 600, and no swing.
If Bocchi was so afraid of missing 3NT, why not double 3H with
the intention of bidding 3NT over 3S, or 5C over 4S? And if Duboin

Lauria could have tested declarer by winning the SA  and shifting
to a club. Manoppo would then have been forced to choose between
the club finesse and taking the ace to play three rounds of hearts.
However, with both lines working, there was no way to go down
in 4S: plus 420.

In the play Duboin saw that he might be presented with the choice
between the club finesse and the hearts 3-3 (see Open Room) and
found a brilliant countermove. After scoring the DK he played
a low heart to the king to get an honest count signal from N/S.
The play went as expected and when North returned a club Duboin
rose with the ace to cash the third heart. When this stood up
he could claim his contract for plus 420 and a push.

{
OR - Using the dictum "six-five, come alive," Lasut started proceedings
with 3H. When this rode around to Lauria, he had some choices
available (3NT, double or 3S). 3NT seemed to offer the most promise
(he had some control over the preemptor with the HA), and would
be the choice advocated by the sidelined Bob Hamman. So, 3NT
it was. This lost the excellent small slam in clubs when Versace
had little choice but to pass. The HK held the first trick, and
declarer lost the CQ to West (for safety) for a disappointing
plus 660.

{
CR - But not that disappointing! Here, Sacul decided to double,
and Karwur jumped to 5C on his ratty club suit. This prompted
an exchange of cue-bids, and a GSF in clubs with 5NT. At least
that was Sacul's interpretation - Karwur was on a different wavelength
[DC]. He jumped all the way to 7C, which had some play. He correctly
negotiated the club suit, but had to take a spade finesse to
make his grand slam. When he didn't, he was down one: minus 100.
13 IMPs to Italy, instead of 16 IMPs to Indonesia. Italy tied
the match at 103 all. As is so often the case, stopping in six
would have been enough for a big gain.

{
CR - A far less scientific auction from the Indonesians in this
room. When 2D was raised to 3D, Karwur blasted RKCB, and received
a 5D response (one or four keycards). It appears they can't show
the club void over Blackwood (6C?). The D2 lead was taken in
hand, and the spade finesse apparently worked for declarer (the
SQ held trick two!). Declarer changed tack and played HA, H10,
collecting all three face-cards. A second spade finesse sealed
his fate - down one: minus 100. A gigantic 16-IMPs gain for Italy,
who snatched the lead 119-108, with only three deals remaining!

{
OR - I have to admit I wouldn't have bid over a 15-17 1NT opening
with that East hand, but Lasut did - and earned a big swing for
his side. 2S was "Reject" - an artificial invitation to 3NT based
on a balanced hand or a hand with a six-card suit. Manoppo's
3NT showed a maximum notrump without a weak doubleton. In theory,
3NT was too high, but how could Lauria possibly find the killing
club lead? When he didn't, Manoppo knocked out Versace's diamond
stopper and made his ninth trick with the HK. Plus 600 was a
very good result for Indonesia.

CR - Duboin's third seat 1NT was strong (15-17 HCP), and Sacul
entered the bidding with 2D, showing both majors with better
spades than hearts. When Karwur bid 2H, Bocchi didn't want to
get involved and passed. When the defenders guessed clubs for
Karwur (DK, club switch) and set up his DJ as well, all he had
to do was draw trumps. Plus 110 meant 12 IMPs to Indonesia, now
back in the lead by 1, 120-119. Could it be more exciting?

{
OR - The bidding started naturally, North looking for a spade
raise with 3S. South couldn't accommodate (although singleton
jack can be very powerful - indeed, as here) and bid 3NT despite
having no red suit stoppers. Lauria didn't trust his heart stopper
and judged it very unlikely that 5C would go down with 3NT making.
Thus the Italian pair reached the best contract. West cashed
his ace-king of hearts and declarer had the rest for plus 600.

{
CR - For some reason Karwur deemed his hand unsuitable for a
preempt. Now it was West who kicked off with 2C, showing both
majors. When Karwur overcalled 3C Sacul had no reason to look
beyond 3NT. With hearts 5-3 declarer could have had a nasty guess
in that suit (low heart to the ace and a low heart back), but
with the actual split there was no danger. In fact Duboin, who
knew his partner would have bid 3H with J10-fifth, shifted to
a diamond at trick two. Sacul claimed 12 tricks for plus 690.
Indonesia gained 3 IMPs to extend their lead to 4 IMPs, 123-119,
going into the final deal of the match.

{
OR - The score: Indonesia 123 - Italy 119. Last board. Lauria's
1C was possibly short, and Lasut's sequence announced a balanced
19-21 HCP. N/S lost their four-four spade fit (they make two)
when Lauria passed Versace's non-forcing 1H bid (1S by opener
would be forcing in their methods). The S2 went to declarer's
ace, and the CK went to North's ace. In the fullness of time,
Lasut came to three spades, one heart and three clubs. Making
one: plus 90 for Indonesia, a good result. The Italians needed
(from the Closed Room) plus 220-350 to tie, or 360 or more to
win.

{
CR - The Indonesians found their spade fit in this room, when
their methods were less restrictive (Sacul could rebid 1S in
peace). Bocchi intended to die with his boots on, if it came
to that, and so reopened with 2NT, suggesting length in the minors.
Karwur pressed on to 3S. The defense can come to three spades,
one heart and one diamond for down one (Indonesia wins 124-119).
The Vu-graph audience knew it too, and erupted. In the hoopla,
nine tricks were mistakenly claimed: plus 140, and 6 IMPs. In
the books the score will be recorded as Indonesia 129 - Italy
119. Congratulations to Henky Lasut-Eddy Manoppo and Denny Sacul-Franky
Karwur, the 2000 IOC Grand Prix winners. Indonesia hosts the
2001 Bermuda Bowl and Venice Cup in Bali next fall. Y'all come!
