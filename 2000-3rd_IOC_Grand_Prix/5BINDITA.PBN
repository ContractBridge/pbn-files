{
OR - With both heart honors in North, EW can make 4D if they
take the correct view in spades, but to reach it after a 14-16
1NT and a pre-emptive overcall isn't easy. Neither East nor West
scraped up a take-out double of 3C, so Lasut was left to play
his comfortable contract. He won the trump lead and led the H8.
If he intended to pass it we don't know, but when Ferraro covered,
hoping de Falco's little heart was the six, Lasut could use his
heart spots to build a tenth trick. +130 NS.

{
CR - With a singleton club and length in the other suits, Karwur
used Stayman and passed Sacul's response, buying the contract.
That strain was better than notrump, but worse than diamonds,
and when the defense started with a spade ruff in the short hand,
and declarer later mis-guessed trumps, the result was a disappointing
two down for EW. +200 NS, 2 IMPs to Italy.

[Contract "4H"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
OR - The Italian system (strong club, four-card majors) backfired
on this board. Presumably, after 3C, East's length in his bid
suits was still unclear. De Falco would have done better to bid
3S over 3D. 3H instead of 4H from Ferraro might have worked also,
East bidding 3S belatedly. In 4H declarer misguessed trumps to
go one down. With a right view in trumps the contract can be
made, even if South holds up the ace of hearts twice. Declarer
cashes two rounds of spades and then plays clubs to neutralize
South's fourth trump.

OR - The Precision auction propelled NS into 4S - a perfectly
reasonable place to be. After Ferraro had led the H6, game had
no chance. DeFalco won the HK and returned the D10. Ferraro won
the DA and still had two trump tricks to come. A fairly normal

{
CR - Lauria's club could be short and Versace made a negative
double on the South hand. Their notes aren't clear on why he
couldn't bid 1S (probably shows precisely four cards). Versace's
3C raise enthused Lauria enough that he bid 3NT over Karwur's
competitive 3H bid. When the H10 was led, the gamble had paid
off. Declarer had nine tricks - two hearts, one diamond and six
clubs. A magic plus 600, and 12 IMPS to Italy, who had taken
back the lead by 32 to 22 IMPS.

{
OR - If West hadn't passed initially, to open 4S with the East
hand would be dubious, to put it mildly. Great distribution and
three first-round controls isn't what your partner should expect
when you open with a pre-empt. And even here, where West passed
and only had 7 working HCP, 6S is cold if played by East. Maybe
4S in third seat isn't so good, either - [AW]. +680 EW.

{
OR - NS reached the normal 3NT after a precision 1D and an inverted
raise. After the spade lead Manoppo ran the queen of clubs, for
a quick and painless one down. Declarer could have succeeded
if he had followed Zia's Bols tip: 'If they don't cover, they
don't have it'. Nine tricks can be made by overtaking the queen
of clubs and playing hearts for four tricks. Manoppo's problem
was that he didn't know for sure that spades were 5-3. With a
4-4 split he could afford to give up a club.

believe East had made a belated overcall on only ace-fifth. Therefore
he led the jack of hearts from hand, hoping to find East with
the queen and west with the ten. Now the clever play in clubs
only resulted in a second undertrick!

enough, Lauria ended the action with a 4S bid. The HA was cashed

OR - 1D was 11-16, natural or 12-14, balanced; and 2NT showed
13-15, balanced. In view of his four diamonds, de Falco could
expect Lasut to be balanced, too. If that assumption is correct,
a passive lead is often best, so a heart would get my vote. But
not de Falco's. He chose to attack, not with a killing diamond
but with a spade, and when Ferraro won his ace it was all over.
If Ferraro ducks instead, Manoppo has to guess well to make his
contract - [AW].

losing to the king. Karwur ducked the heart return, won the SJ

{
OR - A vulnerable weak two on this East hand, with a bad suit
and stacks of defensive values, would not be everyones choice.
Both DeFalco and Sacul thought otherwise, though. DeFalco had
to start with a multi and Ferarro's nebulous 2H response was
followed by two passes, Lasut might have balanced, But it is
hardly automatic. North led a spade and declarer won with dummy's
queen to play a club. North won and was not hard pressed to find
the trump switch. This enabled the defenders to cash 3 clubs,
to go with there three trump tricks. North-South +100

{
CR - Sacul's natural weak two opening meant that it was North
who found himself in the pass out seat. Lauria reentered the
fray with a natural 2NT bid and Versace raised to game. Sacul
correctly attacked with a black suit but his choice of a club
was not as killing as the alternative would have been. It was
not all over yet ... Lauria won the club lead in hand and advanced
the D8. This was Sacul's last chance, but his play of the jack
was not optimal. Having stolen a diamond trick, Lauria then used
his club entries to pick up East's HQ. Nine tricks. +400 and
7 IMPS to Italy

{
OR - Even by modern standards, the South hand is not worth a
vulnerable weak two bid. When North didn't throw in a light third
seat opening, East was left to open a strong club in fourth.
The weak jump overcall couldn't prevent EW reaching the normal
3NT. With no outside entry, South forgot about hearts and tried
a surprise attack in spades. De Falco cashed three rounds of
spades to find out he had four tricks in the suit. A ninth trick
could easily be developed in clubs. Thanks to the very lucky
breaks declarer ended up with all the tricks.

{
CR - At this table North did open light in third seat. This teaser
was quickly brushed aside by EW. Again South led a spade against
3NT. Sacul was pretty sure the king of clubs was onside, so he
crossed to a high diamond immediately for a club finesse. Just
like De Falco he made all the tricks.

{
OR - West's 2C bid showed a weak hand with at least 4-4 in the
majors. North made a card-showing double and East bid 2D (pass
would be club tolerance). South got involved with a 3C bid and
raised 3S to 4S. It makes sense to bid naturally if the opponents
can hold four small in the major. North corrected the impression
with a 5C bid, to end an adventurous auction. The H3 went to
dummy's ace and the C2 brought the bad trump news. Declarer played
the H6 to the king, and ruffed the H7. Ten tricks only. Plus
50 for EW.

{
CR - An interesting 2D bid by Franky Karwur. What was his agenda?
Lauria made a natural 2H reverse, and Versace awaited developments
with 2S. Karwur emerged from the woodwork once again with a double.
Versace bid to his cold 3NT only to be doubled by Sacul (listening
to Karwur). A trifle insecure, Versace bailed out in 4C. So that
was Karwur's agenda! Declarer had ten tricks for plus 130. 5
IMPS to Italy, who lost the match by a mere 2 IMPS - 46-44. Both
teams easily qualifying for the semi-finals tomorrow.
