{
OR - "When in doubt, bid one more" is the standard advice on
swing deals, based on the assumption that if you're wrong bidding,
it's still cheaper than if you pass and are wrong. Here, Eric
Rodwell, South, did what we all would have: bid 5H when he discovered
that Jeff Meckstroth's 2D opening was a weak two-bid in hearts
(sort of). That happened to be a phantom sacrifice, but when
Jean-Christophe Quantin, East, took the push on the same assumption,
USA had the last laugh. +300 NS.

CR - The French have more disciplined weak two-bids, so Hervé
Mouiel, North, passed initially, but bid 4H over Paul Soloway's
pre-emptive raise to 3S. Bob Hamman bid another spade, as who
wouldn't, and after two passes Mouiel thought enough of his bits
and pieces in the minors to hope for a set. That wouldn't have
been the right thing to do if hearts had been 3-1, but here it
worked like a charm. +50 NS, but 6IMPs to USA, taking the lead
in the match.

1C, which gave North a cheap opportunity to introduce his diamond
suit. And after that, North-South were always going plus on the
board: in 1NT, 3D or on defense against 3H or 3S (a ruff in the
other major). In 1NT, South won the spade lead, took a diamond
finesse, saw the defenders cash their spade tricks and play a
club through. But since West was marked with the remaining kings,
he went up ace, cashed his diamond winners and end played West
for his eighth trick. +120 NS.

CR - Over the Americans' four-card major suit opening, North
couldn't risk an overcall, and when East raised to 2S, South
felt his hand was too weak (or maybe a heart short) for a take-out
double. That meant USA was in +110 territory until North came
to life with 3D. He bought a nice dummy and timed the play very
well. On the spade lead he ducked and continued with HA, heart.
That meant he could strip the majors and exit with DA, diamond,
forcing the defenders to open up clubs. +110 NS. No swing.

3S over Meckstroth's 3D game-try. This was mercifully undoubled,

trump queen successfully. A spade to the ten brought the unsettling
news in the trump suit. The HJ was captured by North's HA to
play his remaining club to South's king. South neglected to play
the SK when in, and allowed declarer to escape for down one.

{
CR - 1NT was 14-16 and 2NT asked for a five-card major (in case
there was a 5-3 spade fit). 3H was natural and 4D showed heart
support, maximum and a diamond control, but West was too weak
to be interested. Here, the diamond lead came from North, but
the play was essantially the same as in the open room. East-West
took the first eleven tricks, South the two last. +650. No swing.

{
OR - Most top level pairs go out of their way to open preemptively
in first or third seat non vulnerable. Here Eric Rodwell had
no qualms about opening three clubs. 3NT was a two-way shot.
It could make or give East a problem. If West had passed the
double Meckstroth would surely have run to four clubs. As it
was NS scored an easy +100 in four hearts. A good result for
the USA.

{
CR - The French have a more solid approach to preempting, so
South passed in first seat. After one club Hamman had a choice
between one spade and double. With bad spades and an excellent
four card suit in the other major he chose the latter. South's
belated preempt bought it in four clubs. In the play declarer
had to guess diamonds to land his contract. Mouiel played East
for the ace of diamonds and went one down.

{
OR - Quantin's 4C bid was a splinter in support of spades. Two
cue-bids followed, and Chemla, a little worried about his poor
spade suit, bid only 4S. Perhaps he should have taken charge
with RKCB, and upon hearing 5H (two keycards without the trump
queen), he could give partner a choice of slams with 6D. Partner
must have some diamond length after the 4C splinter. The C2 was
led to declarer's CA, and a spade was led dummy's king. Declarer
took the safety play by playing a diamond towards hand, and lost
a diamond ruff. +450 to EW.

{
CR - Soloway and Hamman were playing strong club, and Levy's
3C bid allowed EW to pinpoint the diamond fit. The levels taken
more or less dictated that the spade fit would be lost. 6D was
duly reached when controls were shown. The 1H bid showed 8 to
11 points. The C2 was led, and taken by declarer. The club was
ruffed, trumps drawn, and the SA was knocked out for 12 tricks.
+920 to EW, and 10 imps to USA. The Americans were firing on
all cylinders, and led by a whopping 49 to 2 at the half-time
mark.
