{
OR - E/W have 25 HCP between them, and happen to have a miraculous
spade stopper. But do they make a game? No. After a natural sequence,
Karwur declared  3H. When Hamman shifted to the CQ at trick two,
Karwur thought it a good idea to get rid of his spade loser.
It wasn't, because now NS could force declarer, preventing him
from using his established diamonds. Two down: minus 100. If
Karwur leads a low diamond at trick three, he later can ruff
a diamond and use dummy's S9 to force a trump from South - a
line that results in nine tricks.

{
CR - When Rodwell balanced with 2H, and later treated his spades
honors as a full stopper, Meckstroth fell in love with his heart
honors and raised to 3NT. Manoppo's attitude lead away from the
ace-king was a good start for Rodwell, but as he "knew" the DK
was with North, the contract depended strictly on hearts three-three.
When they split four-two, Rodwell had to go two down: minus 200.
Although USA started with a 12-IMP carryover, Indonesia had scored
36 unanswered IMPs in the first stanza, and led 36-12 to start
the second.

{
OR - After a nice quiet start to the auction it was up to Bob
Hamman, North, to decide upon the final denomination. He must
have been worried about the value of his eight-card club suit
in a heart contract, but with some ruffing values and trump support,
he raised 3H to four. This would have been fine had Soloway's
trumps been slightly better. Declarer did his best in the play,
but suffered a trump promotion in the ending for one down: minus
50.

[Declarer "N"]
{
CR - The Dutch world champion Marijke van der Pas once wrote
a Bols tip called: 'Play in your own long suit.' Manoppo followed
this advice when he simply blasted 5C over 1S, not worrying about
a possible slam opposite a limited partner (strong club system).
This proved to be the right decision. In 5C declarer needed to
find only the DA or the HK onside (after a spade lead). There
was no defense on this layout: plus 400. 10 IMPs to Indonesia,
46-12.

{
OR - The Indonesians bid to an unmolested 3D when Hamman deemed
the North hand unworthy of a vulnerable overcall. A reasonable
3NT was missed (declarer must guess the diamonds correctly, more
or less) when Karwur "conservatively" passed 3D. Hamman started
the HQ to Soloway's ace, and the S3 went to the jack. Hamman
switched back to hearts. When Karwur passed the D10 to Soloway's
queen, he maintained control and communications and had nine
tricks, losing two spades, one heart and one diamond. Plus 110.

{
CR - An active auction in this room, as should be expected with
Meckwell present. Here Manoppo saw value in the North hand, and
Lasut's raise forced some close decisions on the Americans. East's
sequence srongly sugested a sixth club so Rodwell, counting on
the CQ to solidify the suit, shot out 3NT. Hearts were cleared
and on the run of the clubs the defenders discarded only spades.
Now Manoppo's overcall payed a huge dividend when Rodwell, crediting
Lasut with the HA and a top spade, played the overcaller for
the DQ. Down one; 4 IMPs to Indonesia.

OR - Hamman treated his SK as a doubleton and opened 1NT (14-16),

with clubs, and Hamman took the chance to introduce his diamonds
while the bidding was low. Momentum carried E/W to 4S, and Soloway
led the D4. Had Sacul played low from dummy, Hamman has to withhold
the DK to defeat the contract - hardly an obvious play (Soloway
may have Q654). But when he put up the DJ, N/S were in command.
Soloway hopped up with the HA and returned the CQ. One down:
minus 100.

CR - Can you believe it? Manoppo also thought the North hand
was OK for 1NT. And when Meckstroth's natural 2S overcall was
passed around to him, he re-opened with a double although his
SK had no value. What a tough guy! He managed to push EW to 3S,
but that contract was cold so his efforts were in vain. More
so since 4C is defeated only if Rodwell finds the unlikely diamond
lead. Would you have bid 4C with Lasut's cards? Maybe you should.
Now it was 3S making three: plus 140. 6 IMPs to USA, their first
in the match. Indonesia, 50-18.[AW]

OR - 1C was strong, 1D negative, 1S natural and forcing, and
2C an artificial 5-7 relay without support (2H would have promised
six). After some natural bidding 3NT was reached. The repeated
spade bids convinced East to lead a diamond. Declarer could have
done better by putting in the nine at the first trick. West would
then have been forced to duck his ace twice to prevent declarer
from taking three diamond tricks. As it went it was up to Hamman
to guess hearts at trick six. When he failed to do that he went
one down: minus 50.

CR - Lasut upgraded his hand to make a positive response to the
strong club. Against 3NT Meckstroth led the SQ and continued
the suit when declarer held up. West did well to duck his ace
of diamonds twice to give the defense any chance at all. The
four-card ending was cute. If Rodwell had played a heart declarer
undoubtedly would have risen with the ace to throw East in with
the HK. After the spade return Manoppo got the hearts right for
Plus 400 and a 10-IMP gain. Indonesia led now, 60-18.

He "walked the dog" with his 3D and 4D bids. Hamman's 1S bid
(usually at least five) gave N/S a remote shot at arriving in
the lucky heart game. Soloway seemed to do his best with a 2S
raise, and a free 3H bid. The spade "filling" and doubleton club
being the key to handling a tenth trick in hearts. A tough hand
to judge. The SK lead held Karwur to his contract. He lost one
spade, one heart and one club for plus 130.

the lead value) over the 2H raise. Sacul eschewed any game try,
and merely competed with 3H, ending game chances. Meckstroth's
balancing 3NT was along the lines of: four diamonds and longer
clubs. Rodwell chose to play in clubs, and the singleton D2 was
led by Sacul. As there was no quick entry to the North hand,
declarer escaped any diamond ruff, and had ten tricks: plus 130.
No swing. USA still way behind, 18-60.

1D. When he chose the former, Sacul showed 5+ hearts with 2D,
and Soloway seized the chance to double for the lead. Karwur
accepted the transfer, which for most pairs means would show
a third heart. Maybe Sacul thought so too, since over Hamman's
3D he bid one more. 3H should make easily enough, but Karwur
mistimed the play and went one down on a spade ruff: minus 100.

expecting both sides to have eight trumps only. Then, it's wrong
to bid three over three as at least one of the contracts figures
to go down. After the C10 lead, the defense took three aces and
two club ruffs plus a late spade trick. Two down: minus 100.

{
CR - CR - Meckstroth, true to form, judged this to be a 1H overcall.
Over Sacul's negative double, Rodwell redoubled to show his strength.
Meckstroth's 2H bid ended the auction at a different tempo than
the Open Room, but ended it nonetheless. The H5 lead gave declarer
the same route to ten tricks as in the Open Room: plus 170. No
swing. USA were having trouble scoring, and trailed 60-23 at
this point.

OR - Hamman showed his main feature before raising to 3S, forcing,
just in case Soloway had the right cards for slam, then signed
off in 4S. With the contract played from the right side, it was
never in danger, and on the CK lead Soloway made ten tricks by
drawing trumps. Making four: plus 420.

{
CR - At this table, Manoppo jumped to 4H, showing prime spade
support, a singleton heart and values for game. Lasut had quite
a good hand in context, with nothing wasted in hearts and two
aces, but since he had to go past the safety level of 4S to make
a slam try, he wisely signed off in game, for plus 420, and a
push.

{
OR - A hand for a bidding contest! Can N/S avoid 3NT and end
up in 4S instead? It was too tough for Hamman-Soloway, who had
a natural sequence to the obvious (= no fit) game. East had the
easiest lead problem ever and got cute by leading fifth best.
On the run of the clubs West discouraged both hearts and spades,
so East duly found the diamonds shift for two down: minus 200.

{
OR - Soloway announced a club positive over Sacul's weak 2S,
and Karwur took the three-level from Hamman, who made a forcing
pass to await developments. Soloway reopened with an action double,
leaving Hamman a complex problem. He solved it by burying his
hearts and supporting clubs, then subsided over Soloway's 5C.
Soloway would have cue-bid 4D/4S with an ace, so Hamman was virtually
certain that the pointed aces were with the opposition. The SA
was cashed, followed by the D7 to West's ace. Declarer had the
remainder of the tricks for plus 400.

{
CR - The strong club auction was identical up to the 3S juncture.
Manoppo, encouraged by partner's 3C bid (5+ clubs and 8+ HCP),
decided to gamble that Lasut held a diamond control (highly likely
on the given auction to date), and launched into RKCB. The 5C
response showed one keycard (1430 responses), and Manoppo dropped
him like a hot potato. The defense grabbed their two aces immediately,
and declarer had his eleven tricks: plus 400. No swing. Indonesia
won the set 24-11 and led 60-23 with only twelve deals remaining.
