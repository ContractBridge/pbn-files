{
OR - An unexciting 3NT to start the match. Richard Freeman's
1H rebid on four small looks wrong to me, especially since a
descriptive 1NT rebid is available - [AW]. However, the 1H bid
had the advantage of putting North (Chuangcheng Ju) on  lead,
with no reason to select the HA (he led a spade). Nick Nickell
could have cashed his nine top tricks, getting three overtricks
when the CQ dropped, but instead he led a heart himself. The
defense could have taken four tricks (sometimes they can take
five...), but they didn't. Plus 490 after all!

CR - Here, 3NT was declared by East when Xueliang Cao upgraded
his hand to a 13-15 HCP 1NT. Soloway led the HK and Hamman must
have had hopes of defeating the contract. Unfortunately, the
lead was from a four-card heart suit, and after the defenders
cashed their four heart tricks declarer had the rest. Plus 400:

{
OR - The West hand poses an interesting bidding problem after
a 1H opening on the right. You're obviously a little strong for
a simple 1S overcall. 3NT looks like a reasonable gamble, although
you might achieve an embarrassing result if North fails to lead
his partner's suit. Nickell opted for a take-out double. His
intention was to bid some number of spades next to show a strong
hand. When Freeman made a voluntary bid over Ju's artificial
(clubs) 1NT, Nickell knew how many spades to bid. There was nothing
to the play: plus 420.

now was more dangerous to overcall 3NT, since there was a bigger

R - A perfectly normal auction, ending at 2S, by South. Game
in spades has some play, but is virtually impossible to bid,
even if North chooses to bid 1NT at his first turn (Ju could
not, as 1NT would have been artificial). The DQ was led as a
kind of a "least of evils" approach to the defence. It didn't
test declarer on this layout. Zhong Fu won the DK, and played
the SK to East's ace. Freeman cashed the HK, and played a club
to West's ace. That was all for the defense. Ten tricks, plus

and finessed the D10 immediately. He pitched his heart on the
DA, and knocked out the SA. East tried the HK instead of exiting
with his remaining spade. This had the effect of putting pressure
on West in three suits, and he was squeezed out of his small
club. Declarer led a club to the queen and a club to the nine,

twice. Yang also led a club to the ten and ace. Expecting East
to be five-five in the rounded suits, Soloway didn't need to
finesse in spades (if East has the SK doubleton, there will be
four diamond tricks), so he played SA, spade instead. He lost
one trump trick, but later took the correct view in diamonds,
of course. Plus 620, for a good push.

2D was game-forcing Stayman. The rest of the bidding was natural,
West making a slam try with 4D. Again East signed off, with terrible
cards for a spade slam. The play was identical to that of the
Open Room. Plus 420: no swing. Ironically, there is a slam on
the East/West cards after all, but it's in clubs, and the suit
was never bid at either table in two (more-or-less) unimpeded

3NT probably showed some slam interest (it's not mentioned on
their convention card) but South had too little to suggest a
slam. The cards lay well for declarer, and with the SQ doubleton

4H from Hamman. Although Yang did not promise the world with
his negative double, Cao reasoned that the opponents' bidding
and Yang's failure to bid notrump made it likely that the partnership
hands would mesh well. Hence Cao's slam try of 6C. The lead of
the HA was worst for the defense; Cao took the double spade finesse,
discarding his diamond on the HK. On a minor-suit lead, declarer

{
OR - The modern style is to overcall 1S with the North hand,
and then double if room permits. Ju, North, was from the old-fashioned
school, and he doubled the 1H opening bid. When 4H came back
to him, he probably wished he was a little younger. He doubled
again, and partner offered two places to play with 4NT. With
the actual spade layout, 4S would have failed by one trick, so
this wasn't a total disaster for China. Freeman led the HA and
switched to a trump. Declarer had to lose two spades, one heart
and one club for down two: minus 200.

{
CR - After two passes, Yang felt the West hand was closer to
a weak-two bid than a one-bid. Hamman, being from the old and
the new school, chose to overcall 2S, rather than double 2H.
Cao, wanting to put some pressure on NS, leapt to a precarious
level. His 5H effort attracted (not surprisingly) a double, and
declarer couldn't avoid losing one spade, two diamonds and one
club for two down doubled, minus 500. 12 IMPs to the USA, 22-19.

{
OR - West has a nasty rebid problem after the 1H response. The
hand is definitely not good enough for a 2D reverse. Not willing
to rebid 2C, Nickell improvised by bidding his three-card spade
suit. It did not affect the final contract, which became the
obvious 3NT. Declarer had little trouble taking ten tricks; plus
430.

CR - 1C was strong and the 1NT response showed 8-13 HCP and a
balanced hand. West simply bid 3NT, not worrying about the heart
suit. As at the other table South led a spade and again declarer
took ten tricks. No swing.

{
OR - It would be easy to say that Freeman simply bid too much
with his balanced  six-count, nonvulnerable, but with no diamond
ruff and the CK onside he would have had a fighting chance to
make it. Fu led the DK, saw Ju's nine, and shifted nonetheless
to the HK. Declarer won the HA, played a spade to hand, and took
the losing club finesse. The roof caved in on him now: DA, diamond
ruff, HJ, club ruff left him three down. Minus 150.

{
CR - Cao-Yang's Precision auction kept them low. Soloway mentioned
both red suits, and both Yang and Cao offered action doubles
before coming to rest in 2S. The HJ went to declarer's ace, and
a declarer went to a trump to take the losing club finesse where
a second round of trumps would have secured the contract. Easier
said than done, however. The defence gathered in their six defensive
tricks for down one: minus 50. China gained 3 IMPs to conclude
the first half.  A curiosity: both teams recorded gains of 12,
6, 3 and 1 IMP for a score of 22-22.
