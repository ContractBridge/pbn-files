{
OR - When Simons-Pasman came to rest in 2H, Klar backed into
the auction with a minor-oriented 2NT. Her distribution augered
against this action; the 2-2 major distribution, and her minors
5-4 instead of 4-5. The reason being, if partner is 3-3, she
will choose clubs. The Dutch pair could have extracted 500 from
3C, but chose to play in 3H. A spade lead is required to defeat
this contract, and when the DK was led, declarer had time to
throw her spade loser on the DQ. She had nine tricks: plus 140.

{
CR - In this room, Quinn opened a 14+-17 HCP notrump, and Breed
decided to make a game invitation. As a direct 2NT carried other
meanings, Breed had to go through Stayman to invite. When the
heart fit was uncovered, Breed made the interesting choice of
2NT, to invite the notrump game. Her 4333 distribution made the
likelyhood of mirrored hands a possibility. Again, a spade lead
was needed to defeat the contract. Malinowski led the D3, and
declarer had eight top tricks: plus 120. One IMP to the European
women.

{
OR - Klar had some security when she jumped to 4S (the 2S rebid
by Jackson announced a four-card spade suit). Jackson made a
forcing pass over the 5C sacrifice (which is down two or three
- depending on the club guess), which convinced Klar that the
five-level would be safe. It wasn't. However, since Pasman couldn't
get Simons in for a diamond through declarer, Klar had the time
to draw trumps, and knock the HA out for her diamond pitches.
A fortunate eleven tricks for E/W: plus 450.

{
CR - The auction began the same way in this room. Quinn's 2NT
advance had four-card support written all over it, and Breed
was a little more circumspect than her counterpart in the Open
Room. The four-level had some appeal, but the five-level was
"a bridge too far". Breed led the C2, in an effort to obtain
a heart ruff (wouldn't the C9/8 carry the suit preference code?).
This simply allowed declarer an overtrick, when the HA proved
to be the only loser now. Twelve tricks: plus 480. One IMP to
Europe, leading 2-0 on the set.

entity. This proved to be a bit of a distortion, and lost the
safest game contract - 4H. Jackson's sequence showed 4-5 in the
majors, leaving Klar with little choice other than 3NT. A club
lead will defeat 3NT (unless declarer embarks on the double-dummy
line of: win the CQ, diamond to the queen, three high hearts,
SQ - nine tricks). In fact, she won the CQ, three rounds of hearts,
spade to the jack, DA, DQ. The defence took the rest for down
three: minus 150.

the jack, and tried to run the hearts. When they failed to break,
she played the D6 to her queen, and cashed both pointed aces.

{
OR - Simons probably felt she was the H10 short for a 3H preempt,
and chose the safer course with a 2H bid. This attracted a negative
double from Klar on her 5-5 in the black suits. A 5-3 spade fit
would be difficult to find after this start. Not to worry, Jackson
jumped to 3NT. Unfortunately for the Europeans, the H2 was led,
which gave up the ninth trick on the go. An opportunity lost,
as 6C from East is iron-clad. Plus 600 to North America.

{
CR - In this room, Quinn didn't think she needed the H10 for
a 3H bid. This level shut out Malinowski for the moment. When
Hellemann re-opened with 4C, Malinowski's hand suddenly became
very good. She tried to impart this information to partner with
a nebulous 4S cue-bid in support of clubs. Hellemann was not
on the same wave-length. She interpreted the 4S as natural (though,
how she came to that conclusion escapes me [DC]). A disasterous
down four: minus 400. 14 IMPs to North America (16 IMPs to Europe
if 6C was bid, and 3NT defeated).

{
OR - A 14+-17 HCP notrump was Jackson's choice on the East cards.
The pros were the honor doubletons and the sixteen HCP. The cons
were the five-card major within the 2524 framework. It did make
for an easy auction though. Klar simply transferred to spades
with a Texas (South African) Transfer. The CJ went to declarer's
queen, and the H3 played to dummy's ace. The S5 to declarer's
king, and the S2 to South's queen. A low diamond by Simons would
test declarer immensely. When the C2 was returned, declarer had
eleven tricks (DA slept): plus 450.

more attractive. Declarer won the CA, and played the SK to North's

Jackson opened a heavy weak 2H bid, and this rode around to Pasman
who had a difficult bid to make. She had three choices: double,
2NT or 2S. All flawed in their own way. Her double elicited a
3C bid from Simons (a lebensohlish 9+ HCP). Pasman offered her
spade suit, and Simons raised that to game. Declarer pitched
the heart loser on the DK, and finessed the SJ. A club misguess
netted ten tricks: plus 620.

{
OR - We are not privy to why Pasman chose to rebid 2H in their
ACOL-based system. Simons' 2D bid showed at least five diamonds,
so one would have thought that Pasman would show the outstanding
fit at her second turn, rather than her third. Simons trolled
for the CA with her 3S bid, but when she received 3NT, she simply
gave up and bid 5D. The extraordinary fit never getting a full
hearing. The good slam was lost to the winds. The S5 lead went
to the queen and king, and Jackson tried the effect of the HK.
Making six: plus 620.

{
CR - Breed was under no illusions about delaying her support.
She raised immediately, and three rapid cue-bids drove the partnership
to the good slam. Would the defence give themselves a remote
chance of defeating the slam by ducking the SQ smoothly? In a
way, yes. The trump lead was taken in hand to play HA, H10 -
running it to East's blank king. After setting up the long heart,
declarer had a choice: the spade finesse, or the ruffing finesse
in spades or clubs. She got it right when she passed the SQ successfully.
Plus 1370, and 13 IMPs.

{
OR - Klar's 14+-17 HCP notrump ended the auction in quick fashion.
A slightly pessimistic pass by Jackson on her flat eight-count.
One can make the case for pass when non-vulnerable, but vulnerable
games ought to be investigated when close [DC]. A very loose
North may have entered the auction at the prevailing vulnerability
with a major-oriented action. Pasman declined (though 2H has
some play for N/S). The S3 was led (a club lead defeats 3NT),
and declarer managed nine tricks (three spades, one heart, four
diamonds and one club): plus 150.

{
CR - Malinowski's 15-17 HCP notrump was also dropped like a stone.
North was never going to find the club lead against 3NT, so if
either pair had found 3NT, they would have been 10 IMPs richer.
The S5 lead inevitably allowed declarer to develop her ninth
trick. With the hearts 4-4, and the HA onside, declarer had an
easy time of it. Nine tricks: plus 150. No swing. With two boards
remaining in the last set, North America led 39-11. They had
tied the overall match in IMPs (402-402), but trailed where it
counted - Victory Points.

{
OR - The match was still within reach for the North American
women after their spirited late comeback. A couple of decent
swings, and they would snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
Simons began proceedings with a book vulnerable 3C preempt. Pasman
bid 3NT, and was lucky to survive the heart layout. We can see
that 6C would be outstanding if South's majors were reversed
(with 5C easy), and 3NT would be awful. The D3 lead gave declarer
all thirteen tricks: plus 720. The North Americans had to bid
and make 6C for a dramatic finish.

CR - Quinn opened 3C, and Breed did not investigate higher ideals
with a 3S bid. She bid the same 3NT assayed in the Open Room.
The HJ was advanced, and taken by West's king. The D4 shift allowed
declarer to take the remaining tricks. She had twelve tricks:
plus 690. One IMP to Europe, who trailed on the set - 39-12.
The overall IMP total was amazingly: Europe 403 - North America
402. One last board remained. Would there be enough in the cards
for the North Americans?

{
OR - Jackson doubled 1C, and then showed her strength with a
1NT call at her second turn. The auction implied a 19-21 HCP
balanced notrump - a pretty accurate description. Pasman-Simons
simply bid their cards naturally, and came to rest in 2S. A very
sensible contract, to be sure. Jackson unblocked her two high
spades before playing the DQ to declarer's ace. Declarer scored
four trumps on a cross-ruff, and lost three spades, one heart
and one diamond for eight tricks: plus 110. The match appeared
secure for Europe.

{
CR - In this room, Breed was the first to arrive in 1NT. This
silenced Hellemann, but lost the 4-4 spade fit in the process.
The cross-ruff in spades landed a great many tricks in the Open
Room. Here, there simply wasn't any source of tricks. The CJ
was led to declarer's queen, and Breed started to drive out the
spades. Hellemann pitched a winning club along the way, but defeated
1NT by one trick: plus 50. 4 IMP's to Europe, who lost the set
39-16 (64-56 VPs), but won the I.O.C. 245-233 VPs (407-402 IMPs).
Congratulations to Europe!
