{
OR - With Jeff Meckstroth, North, limited to 15 HCPs, it looks
like Eric Rodwell, South, bid too aggressively when he jumped
to 3H. An invitational sequence ending in 2H would have been
needed to save the board for USA, because on Norberto Bocchi's
CJ lead even 3H would have been too high. East-West were ahead
in the race and managed their entries well enough to secure all
their tricks: two down, minus 100.

{
CR - Richard Freeman overcalled 2D on his skinny suit and caught
a raise. When Alfredo Versace, South, bid 3H, it didn't sound
as invitational as at the other table, so Lorenzo Lauria, North,
passed in comfort. Lauria won the diamond lead and led a trump,
Freeman judging correctly to win, but then he erred by cashing
the DK. If instead he returns the C10, East retains his diamond
entry to cash the defenders' club trick. Lauria knocked out the
HK and later the SK, but by then Freeman was out of clubs; the
club loser went on a spade. Plus 140 NS; 6 IMPs to Italy.

lead of the DQ, Duboin eventually led a trump to the ace, and

{
CR - At this table East was able to open with a natural weak
two in diamonds. This caught South with a nasty bidding problem.
Versace solved it in unorthodox fashion by overcalling on his
strong four-card suit. The play in 2H would have been interesting,
but West decided to raise diamonds. In 3D declarer had to lose
the obvious five tricks. >From the play record it's unclear where
the second undertrick came from. Perhaps Nickell misguessed trumps
(certainly possible). Two down: minus 100. 5 IMPs to USA.

OR - As West might have held a balanced minimum with only two
clubs at the prevailing vulnerability, East was not anxious to
involve himself at his first turn. His delayed entry had no effect
on South, and 4H was duly reached. Bocchi led the singleton D7,
Meckstroth playing ace and another. The C3 return was ruffed
in dummy, and a successful heart finesse taken. Declarer ruffed
his last club in dummy, and played a heart to the ace, claiming
eleven tricks when they broke three-two. Plus 450.

CR - Here, Nickell did up the level to 3C immediately. Versace's
responsive double caught a 3D rebid from Lauria when Freeman
decided not to do any more. Versace, despite his huge diamond
fit, did well to keep the strain search alive, and passed Lauria's
natural 4H continuation. So, with interference, or without, 4H
appears to be reachable. Lauria ruffed the club lead in dummy
to play a heart to the K and A. He played ace and another diamond,
ruffed the club return, and played the H10. When the hearts proved
to be 3-2, declarer claimed eleven tricks. Plus 450: no swing.

{
OR - At this vulnerability Duboin's 1C was either natural with
11-23, or a balanced minimum with 2+ clubs. 1S promised a five-card
suit, and when West rebid 2H to show a strong hand, East-West
were never going to stop short of 4S. If the breaks are normal,
the contract succeeds if North has the DK or if there is no spade
loser. As three rounds of hearts will promote the SQ if South
has it, East's main hope is that North has the doubleton queen.
But no. Two hearts, one diamond and one spade meant one down.
Minus 100.

[Declarer "W"]
{
CR - At this table, 4S was played by West after a transfer sequence.
If you're wondering why East didn't rebid 3D, the answer is that
it would have been forcing to game. 3S wasn't very descriptive,
but at least it showed invitational values, albeit supposedly
with six spades. West, with an eye on the vulnerability, raised
himself to 4S. North cashed two top hearts and returned the H2,
which declarer ruffed with the S7. Luckily for him, South didn't
have the S9 and North the magical doubleton queen, so it was
one down here, too. Minus 100. No swing.

{
OR - East opened a mini-notrump and South doubled for penalties.
West's pass was forcing, asking East to redouble or bid a five-card
minor. 1NT doubled would probably have gone one down, so East's
escape to 2dx was somewhat randomly correct. This probably set
up a forcing situation for NS. North could have been stronger
than he was, so South had to make a move towards game. In 3S
Meckstroth  misguessed hearts when Bocchi switched upon winning
the SQ. One down: minus 100.

double. After a diamond lead, the fate of the contract depended
on the spade guess. Versace got it right, his clue being that
East already had shown up with the DK and CA, making  it likely
that West had both major suit aces for his double.

OR - Rodwell's (9)10-12 HCP 1NT was doubled by Duboin, who really
had it this time. Meckstroth's redouble was a single-suited runout,
forcing 2C. His 2D escape caught a responsive double from Bocchi,
and Rodwell raised the non-vulnerable ante to the three-level.
EW had 1100 here, but allowed the active Meckwell off the hook
with a disappointing 3NT. The D2 went to the nine and queen.
A heart to the ace, a club finesse, and the HQ settled the sordid
affair for twelve tricks. A non-plussed 690 for EW.  [DC]

slam. The H5 was led to Versace's king, and he shifted smartly
to the C10. Declarer won the CQ, and proceeded to take the rest
of the tricks (the thirteenth club providing the parking place
for the diamond - even though that finesse too, was onside).

{
OR - Nowadays, many players use the opening bids of four of a
minor to show a good major suit preempt (4C with hearts, 4D with
spades). The Italians obviously don't, and since a vulnerable
preempt is serious business, West had an easy raise to 5D, hoping
for a singleton club opposite, or no trump losers. South did
well to lead a club, stopping the overtricks. Plus 600.

OR - West opened a mini-notrump (9-12 HCP) and got raised to
game. North had an easy club lead. Declarer's main chance for
a ninth trick was a three-three split in spades. Duboin held
up the CA twice and duly ducked a spade. When the suit didn't
split he was a trick short. A major suit squeeze did not materialize,
because South was discarding after East. In the end North took
the setting trick with the nine of hearts.

{
CR - Here East declared 3NT. The spade lead meant that there
was little hope for a third trick in that suit. Unwilling to
play hearts himself Nickell embarked on a psychological line.
He crossed to the DK and played a club. This worked like a dream
when South broke hearts when in with the S10. Note that declarer
can also win on this layout if he just plays on hearts. When
South covers the jack declarer wins and plays a low one to the
eight next. This is the right play, since a good South wouldn't
normally cover the jack with Q9x or K9x.

{
OR - An unusual occurence - Meckwell missed a game. Rodwell risked
a highly distributional responsive double, prompting Meckstroth
to introduced hearts freely. When Rodwell made the ultra-scientific
call of 4C (he wanted to get to a possible fit slam, and was
trying to get the immense distribution across), Meckstroth simply
had second thoughts about the nature of the double. Declarer
lost a diamond, a heart, and a spade for ten tricks. A gloomy
plus 130.

{
CR - Versace eschewed any thoughts of a responsive double disaster
(a possible penalty pass), and bid his suits naturally. This
is surely the right thing to do when there is such a disparity
in the suits [DC]. Although hearts were first bid naturally at
the four-level, the auction timed out well for Italy. Declarer
ruffed the DA to lead a trump to the queen. The HA, and the CA
brought matters to a close, declarer losing only a spade and
a trump. Plus 650 to NS, and 11 IMPs to Italy, giving them the
lead at the half, 36-28.
