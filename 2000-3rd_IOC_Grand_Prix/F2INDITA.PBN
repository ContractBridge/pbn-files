{
OR - Over Manoppo's strong (15-17 HCP) 1NT, Bocchi could have
doubled to show at least 4-4 in the majors. On another day, that
would have been a good thing to do, but here his sensible pass
worked better. He led his top spade to Duboin's ace, and with
so many lower spots missing, Duboin could read the lead as top
of nothing, so he shifted to the H10, J, Q, and a spade was returned.
When Bocchi released a diamond, Manoppo built a diamond trick
and used the DJ to finesse against the H9. Just made: plus 90.

Here, however, Sacul cashed all his winners, giving Lauria the
rest. Two made: plus 120. 1 IMP to Italy, ahead 27-17. As it
was possible that North held AJ third of clubs and three little
diamonds, Sacul's defense looks better than Bocchi's - even though
it was the wrong one on this deal. [AW]

{
OR - Curiously enough the mundane West hand doesn't fit neatly
into the sophisticated Bocchi-Duboin system, as 1NT would be
an artificial game force and 2C would promise five (nonforcing).
Duboin improvised with 1H, which showed four spades. Against
3NT, hearts had been "spoken" but not bid, and Manoppo had a
straightforward heart lead, the defenders clearing the suit.
Declarer succeeded in sneaking a club through, but South was
wide awake when he tried to do the same in spades. The defense
took three hearts and the two black aces for one down: minus
50.

not to stretch, nonvulnerable. This proved to be the winning
decision. In the play the defense lost one of their heart tricks

queen and Versace failed to continue the suit at trick three.
Plus 130; 5 IMPs to Indonesia; 22-27.

OR - The Indonesian Precision auction arrived in 3NT in a brisk
fashion, the 1NT rebid showing 12-14 HCP. Things could get very
dicey on a diamond lead from West. Declarer would have to do
a fair bit of work to develop his ninth trick, with serious handling
problems. With diamonds bid, albeit nebulously, Duboin led a
spade, helping declarer untangle his communications. He was able
to develop three spades, one heart, one diamond and four clubs
to make his game: plus 400.

{
CR - Versace's 2+ 1C opening was the only visible difference
between this auction and the Open Room's. Neither East player
doubled the final contract for a heart lead, which defeats the
contract forthwith. Declarer would need some serious inspiration
to thread his way home after Karwur's D10 lead: DA, CA, CQ, spade
to the queen, CK, C10, spade to the ten, coming to a heart later.
When he played dummy's DQ at trick one, it was all over. Versace
managed to endplay Sacul for a seventh trick, and down two: minus
100. 11 IMPs to Indonesia, now in the lead 33-27.

OR - 2C showed at least 4-4 in the majors and 4-10 HCP, so Bocchi,
with no assured eight-card fit and only 14 HCP, couldn't do more
than take a preference to 2S. He was aware that a "perfecto"
would make 4S more or less cold (e.g. move the DK to clubs, and
make the H7 the jack), but was willing to pay the price for 
using methods mainly devised to make it difficult for the opponents.
Lasut led a trump, and Bocchi immediately started on clubs. Nine
tricks: plus 140. [AW]

chance, although declarer made a nice try for four heart tricks

CR - East's 2NT was an invitational spade raise with 4+ trumps
and West did well to resist the seduction of a favorable-vulnerability
save. 4H looked like an uphill struggle, but West got the defense
off to a bad start by leading the SA, which established the SK
as a parking place for the diamond loser. Karwur really fell
from grace when he put in the jack on declarer's lead of a small
club. Versace was now able to take a ruffing finesse in clubs.
He now played carefully to make ten tricks. An enormous plus
+620 for N/S and 13 IMPs to Italy, back in front, 40-33.

of his partner's overcalls, and simply bid 2S, and 3S with his
limit raise, concluding the auction. The D6 lead went to Bocchi's
jack (an interesting play), and king. When the spades broke 2-2,

OR - Have you ever thought about stopping below game with 10
HCP opposite your partner's strong (16+) 1C opening? Manoppo
did just that, and as Lasut only took nine tricks in 3S, that
was the right thing to do. What courage! His heart honors didn't
figure to be worth much, and Lasut hadn't bid 3S on the second
round, so it was possible he only had four. 4S is a decent contract,
but with both club honors offside, it would normally fail. A

three trumps, leading to the normal 4S. Versace ducked the opening

the C9 and diamonds didn't break, declarer had only nine tricks.
One down: minus 100 and 6 IMPs to Indonesia, now down only by
1 IMP, 39-40. Does 4S make if declarer draws two rounds of trumps,
then ruffs his diamond loser in dummy? No. He has no quick way
back to his hand, so after cashing his three winners, East leads
a heart for a promotion. [AW]

{
OR - 1D was natural, or a balanced 18-19. Both Bocchi's doubles
were takeout, but I don't understand why Lasut didn't introduce
his seven-card straight flush while the level was low rather
than guess at the four-level. 4H wasn't a terrible spot, although
the double suggested it might be. Bocchi led the DQ, Duboin thought
it might be from Qx, overtook and led a trump, doing declarer's
work for him. A spade to dummy, another trump finesse, HA, and
the CK, hoping the CQ was single or that the defender on lead
had the SQ. No luck. A spade came back; one down.

{
CR - Karwur's Precision 1D opening was either natural, 11-17
or a balanced 12-14; and Sacul's 2D was 9-11 with 5+ diamonds.
When NS found their club fit and bid to 5C, they needed some
luck to make it. They got it in spades (on the lead) and in hearts,
but not in clubs, so 5C went one down: minus 100, and 3 IMPs
to Italy, tying the match at 44-44. As Versace needed the HK
onside, a clearly better line, once the SJ wins, is to use his
spade entries to take 2 heart hooks and then discard his diamond
on the HA. It wouldn't have helped here, but against many 2-1
split it would. [AW]

{
OR - Somewhat surprisingly, Bocchi-Duboin never entered the bidding
with the E/W cards. Bocchi refrained from overcalling 2C at his
first turn and considered it too dangerous to balance over 2D,
expecting partner to hold long spades and a very weak hand (no
overcall). West led a trump, usually best in this type of auction.
Not this time. Declarer lost two trumps and a heart and scored
up plus 130 without a sweat.

{
CR - Here Sacul did overcall directly. With a good length stopper
in clubs and excellent intermediates, Lauria looked for game
after 2D. When South belatedly rebid his six-card suit the level
had become uncomfortably high. 3NT might have been interesting,
but Lauria gave belated diamond support. The club lead got the
defense off to a good start. When Sacul won the DK forced South
with the CK. When he won the DA, he cleared trumps. With declarer
was out of trumps now, the CQ became the setting trick: minus
50. 5 IMPs to Indonesia, ahead 49-44.

{
OR - Bocchi's 1S response showed 0-4 spades and 4-11 HCP (a 1NT
response would have shown at least five spades). Thereafter,
the auction entered a natural mode, culminating in a touch-and-go
3NT. Lasut led the S2, and dummy's ten won the first trick. The
five-one heart break put a crimp in declarer's plans; he couldn't
find a ninth trick and lost two spades, one heart, one diamond
and one club for down one: minus 50.

{
CR - The auction was identical in this room, though it was entirely
natural in context. The H9 pulled its weight on this deal, and
there just wasn't any route to a ninth trick. The CJ lead served
to disconnect declarer from developing any possible game-going
trick. Declarer won the CK, and was allowed to hold the HJ. Twist
and turn as he might, eight tricks were the limit, and declarer
finished down one: minus 50. No swing. After two fifths of the
final, Indonesia led Italy by 5 IMPs, 49-44.
