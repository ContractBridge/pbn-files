with 12-14 or 18-23 HCP. Michal Kwiecien responded 1H, to show
7+ HCPS and 4+ hearts. 1S was natural, but 2C was artificial
and forcing. 2H showed 3 hearts in a balanced 12-14 hand, so
West ended proceedings with 4H. With the trumps 4-1 offside and
the DA behind the king, West lost the four obvious tricks after
the DQ lead. One down; minus 100.

Bartosz Chmurski, North, led the DQ, covered and won by Mariusz
Puczynski's ace. A trump came back, and even though it didn't
matter, it could easily have been the correct defense on another

CR - Bartosz Chmurski's 4D set spades and showed diamond shortage.
With a suitable diamond holding, Mariusz Puszynski decided to
make a second slam try, his 5S asking for good trumps. North
(as is so often the case) didn't have them. In 5S declarer had
to decide whether he could afford the safety-play in trumps,
after a club, ducked to the king, and a second club. If West
has led a club from four you might suffer a ruff when you play
a spade to the king and a spade to the nine. That's why Puczynski
decided to play the SA on the second round; no swing.

play of ducking East's ten, surely judging that the HK was on
his right. The H6 was ducked to the king, and West shifted to
a spade, the queen winning. Declarer cashed the HA, and played
a club to the ten and queen. The spades were cleared, and a club
played to the jack, king and ace. Declarer won the D6 shift with
the king and exited with a diamond. East gathered in his minor
suit tricks, but had to yield a trick to dummy's C8 at trick
13. Down two, for +200 to EW; no swing.

{
OR - With four trumps and fitting diamond honors, West felt his
hand justified a game bid, but isn't that hoping for too much?
And 4S was indeed a poor contract, needing two cards onside plus
trumps to behave. After a heart lead, and a club back, it looks
like declarer has a guess, but that isn't exactly true. To make
4S, he needs North to have the DK, and since North has passed
initially and has shown the HA, he's unlikely to have the CA
too. Trumps behaved and the DK was where declarer wanted it to
be, but the CQ wasn't. One down: minus 100.  [AW]

got what it deserved: a bad board. Without it, East, who was
maximum for his Precision 1S opening in terms of high-card points
(1C would have been 16+) and controls, may well have taken a
shot at 4S once he caught a raise. But now, with the CK looking
more like a deuce, East was content to announce extra strength
with a redouble, then subsided in 3S. Plus 140 EW; 6 IMPs to

his partner was relatively short in hearts, but hadn't made a

boldly bid 3D. This contract went one down, minus 50, the defense

the contract. One could make the case for trumps being three-one

to bid his major. The DJ was led in response to North's double

OR - Most partnerships treat a double of 1NT as takeout of spades,
so for them double would have been out. Not for Pszczola, though.
With four sure side-suit losers, the only question was whether
South could avoid losing two trump tricks in 2S. After three
rounds of hearts, he ruffed and played three rounds of trumps,
later losing two club tricks for one down. 2S can be made, however,
if declarer leads to the SK, finesses in diamonds, cashes the
SA and the diamond tops, and leads a club. Hardly an obvious

{
OR - Once East caught a raise, he simply kept on bidding, as
we all would. And because most opponents are satisfied when they
have pushed their opponents to the five-level, North-South quit
too soon. Of course, they didn't know East-West had such a great
diamond fit, but neither did their opponents, so it was more
or less a guessing game. When the DK was worth a trick, 5S made
on the nose; plus 650 EW.

{
CR - To pre-empt with a freak, especially when you also have
a void, is a dangerous business, and here East was punished when
North-South (more or less) were forced to do the right thing.
As South had hopes of making 6C, he simply bid one for the road.
Had he been just a little lucky, the HQ would have been with
North. As it was, he had to be content with "only" a successful
sacrifice. 6C doubled was minus 100, but Pland gained 11 IMPs.

OR - Kwiecien's 2D was Multi, showing a weak two-bid in either
major. East did very well not to look for a vulnerable game with
his balanced 14-count. The obvious four tricks were lost: Plus
140 to Poland.

{
CR - Here Yang-Cao were playing natural weak two-bids. 2NT was
Ogust and West showed a maximum with one top honour in spades.
East decided to try 3NT, hoping for some minor suit fillers from
partner. The dummy was a disappointment, with the king of hearts
and no ace of spades. After the club lead the contract had no
chance, the defense taking three clubs and two aces. Minus 100:
6 IMPs to Poland.

{
OR - A straightforward auction to 2S. West led the H2, and upon
winning the H10, East shifted boldly to the C10 to the queen
and ace. Declarer played his two high trumps, then tried a club,
losing to East's nine, Declarer ruffed East's continuation of
the CK and played the D2 to the nine and king. East failed to
cash his heart now, and led a diamond to West's ace. Strangely,
declarer claimed seven tricks only, after West cashed his SQ.
The two minor suit jacks provide a parking place for the two
heart losers. Minus 50, just the same.

{
CR - Here Puszynski opted for a preemptive 2S over 1H, as partner
was a passed hand. This ended a very short auction. The H2 was
led to dummy's king and East's ace. The S2 came back, ducked
to the queen, and West shifted to the C5. East won the nine,
and exited with the S4. Declarer ran all his spades trying to
set up an endplay. Cao pitched two small diamonds on the run
of the spades allowing the HJ to score the last trick, but declarer
could have built this trick himself by playing to the D9. Minus
50; no swing. Poland defeated China by 44 to 34 imps.
