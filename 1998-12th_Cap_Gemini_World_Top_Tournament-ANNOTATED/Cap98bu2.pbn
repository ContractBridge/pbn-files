                  16   Berkowitz - Letizia       206

The best score on Friday was recorded by Zia Mahmood and Tony
Forrester. They managed 206 and moved to the top of the standings,
just 4 VP ahead of Jansen-Westerhof who recovered well after a bad
start to score 176. It also was a great day for one of the Italian
pairs: Buratti-Lanzarotti posted a score of 195, which might have been
enough to win the session, but this time only saw them move from 5th
to 3rd. The first day leaders, Helgemo-Helness, mustered only 147 and
drop to 4th spot, but they are still very much in contention with this
decisive Saturday ahead. Chagas-Branco also managed only 148, going
down from 3rd to 6th, just 1 VP ahead of Martens-Szymanowski who with
their 185 rose from 12th to 7th. Honourable mention also for Sun-Wang:
their 182 saw them rise from 14th to 10th, just 1 VP over average now.

                                ROUND 4

           Lauria-Versace - Sun-Wang                25 - 75
           Meckstroth-Rodwell - Berkowitz-Cohen     38 - 62
           Berkowitz-Letizia - Helness-Helgemo      35 - 65
           Hackett-Hackett - Jansen-Westerhof       65 - 35
           Buratti-Lanzarotti - Chagas-Branco       83 - 17
           Lévy-Mari - Martens-Szymanowski          27 - 73
           Mahmood-Forrester - Leufkens-Westra      74 - 26
           Chemla-Perron - Blakset-Christiansen     64 - 36

Last night's first round was a really remarkable one: all winning
pairs scored at least 60, and four winners managed more than 70. The
round was easily won by Buratti-Lanzarotti, who beat last year's
winners Chagas-Branco 83-17. Sun-Wang staged a come-back with 75
against Lauria-Versace, and Zia-Forrester and Martens-Szymanowski won
74-26 and 73-27 respectively against Leufkens-Westra and
Lévy-Mari. Chemla-Perron were on 80 with two boards to go, but
Blakset-Christiansen reduced the margin to only a 64-36
loss. Helness-Helgemo held on with 65, but Jansen-Westerhof lost 35-65
against the Hacketts to drop to fifth place.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ROUND 5

          Sun-Wang - Martens-Szymanowski             45 - 65
          Jansen-Westerhof - Helness-Helgemo         63 - 37
          Lévy-Mari - Lauria-Versace                 52 - 48
          Chagas-Branco - Blakset-Christiansen       90 -  7
          Meckstroth-Rodwell - Mahmood-Forrester     37 - 63
          Leufkens-Westra - Berkowitz-Cohen          37 - 63
          Berkowitz-Letizia - Hackett-Hackett        33 - 67
          Chemla-Perron - Buratti-Lanzarotti         34 - 66

After their setback in the previous round, Chagas-Branco struck back
immediately with an over-maximum 90-7 win against poor
Blakset-Christiansen. As a result, they rocketed back to 5th spot,
having fallen from 3rd to 11th the round before.  Jansen-Westerhof
staged a recovery, beating the leaders 63-37. With Buratti-Lanzarotti
winnng 66-34 against Chemla-Perron, we greeted the Italians as the new
leaders. The Hacketts continued to do well with another 67, and both
Zia-Forrester and Berkowitz-Cohen merrily marched on with 63
each. Down the table, a gap separated the last three pairs, all under
- 50 V.P., from the rest of the field

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ROUND 6

         Sun-Wang - Lévy-Mari                         58 - 42
         Chagas-Branco - Chemla-Perron                41 - 59
         Meckstroth-Rodwell - Leufkens-Westra         53 - 47
         Mahmood-Forrester - Berkowitz-Cohen          69 - 31
         Hackett-Hackett - Helness-Helgemo            55 - 45
         Blakset-Christiansen - Buratti-Lanzarotti    54 - 46
         Martens-Szymanowski - Lauria-Versace         57 - 43
         Berkowitz-Letizia - Jansen-Westerhof         22 - 78

A 78-22 win against Berkowitz-Letizia gave the victory in last night's
last round to Jansen-Westerhof who as a result find themselves back in
the runner-up position they held when the day started. The second best
score of the round was Zia-Forrester's 69-31 against
Berkowitz-Cohen. As Buratti-Lanzarotti managed just 46 against
Blakset-Christiansen (who badly needed a recovery), we see new leaders
again: the familiar figure of Zia Mahmood, this time partnered by Tony
Forrester. The Hacketts just had the edge on Helness-Helgemo,
Chemla-Perron beat Chagas-Branco and Sun-Wang kept up their previous
good work.}

        "BID 'EM UP!"

Waiting for the entrance of the gladiators at the
start of Round 3, the tables, devoid of players but
surrounded by spectators, reminded me of the
occasion when England were playing Scotland in an
International match.  The English Captain told us
to go to the Open Room.  When we arrived, there
were several spectators but no opponents.  I
innocently enquired:  "Which way's North?" and on
being pointed in the right direction, duly sat in
the South seat.  Whereupon a helpful lady advised
me:  "Oh, you can't sit there, that's where the
players sit!"

Right, enough attempted humour, on with the bridge.

The leaders were playing the fifth placed pair and
the match started with a series of deals on which
excessive aggression would have paid dividends.}

Jansen- Westerhof defeated the spade game reached
by Zia and Forrester, but in a different way.  The
play went the same way as at the Helgemo-Meckstroth
table, but here Jansen went in with the \SQ and
returned his last diamond to promote the setting
trick in trumps.}

4-2 (though the defence might have shifted to a
heart if this were the case) so he played a fourth
spade. Jansen won as Forrester threw a club, and
played a third diamond to his partner, as Forrester
threw a heart.  Now Westerhof had to decide whether
to play his partner for the top clubs or the top
hearts, and he thought the suit preference
overtones in spades suggested his partner might
have club cards. The problem with that is that
Forrester's discard of a heart suggests the
contrary:  and if Jansen had taken the \SQ, perhaps
Forrester would just have played on clubs...?} S6 SJ S9

CT CQ {Helgemo's play of a low club to trick one makes it
nearly impossible for declarer to succeed, but on
this hand the defence was not always at its best,
nor was the declarer play.} CK {When Mari led a low club against Søren
Christiansen's 3 NT, declarer put up dummy's Queen
as he badly wanted to be in dummy to play hearts.
It is doubtful, however, if this is the correct
line of play. At the table, Lévy covered the \CQ
with the King, so Christiansen had to win his ace.
He continued a spade to dummy and ran the \H10,
losing to Mari's Queen. A spade came back,
disrupting the entries. Christiansen cashed the
third spade and then played a diamond towards his
hand. Lévy stepped up with the \DK to lead a club
through the J9, and that was one down.}
{When Chagas-Branco were defending against Lauria-
Versace, Alfredo ducked the low club lead round to
the King and his ace, then led a low heart from
hand and retained complete control of the hand,
making nine tricks without difficulty as the cards
lay.  Still, this is not a 100 130844398ne - in fact it
is difficult to find one. Maybe, ducking a spade
at trick two is reasonable, but the defence can
counter that by shifting to a heart on some lies of
the cards.} CJ
