                            ZIA 4 - TONY 2

What looked certain on Saturday afternoon looked far less obvious this
morning.  After two rounds today, it looked in even more doubt, but in
the end there were no problems. ZIA MAHMOOD and TONY FORRESTER are the
winners of the 1998 CAP GEMINI WORLD TOP TOURNAMENT and our
congratulations first of all go to them. For the new honorary member
of Bridge Club ZIA it is his fourth win; for Tony Forrester it is only
his second. Still, Tony joins a select band now: he and Zia are the
only two people ever to win this tournament with more than one
different partner.

'As usual', the runners-up are MASSIMO LANZAROTTI and ANDREA BURATTI
from Italy.  Last year, they could not quite get hold of
Chagas-Branco; this time, catching up Zia and Tony proved one bridge
too far. They were within striking distance with one round to go, but
in the end they fell 21 short. The same margin, however, separated
them from the third prize-winning pair. Though this was an even year,
two-times winners GEIR HELGEMO and TOR HELNESS did not do it again.
Still, they can look back on a very satisfactory tournament.
Congratulations to all the medal winners.

                           Today's Results

                               ROUND 13

          Helness-Helgemo - Martens-Szymanowski      58 - 42
          Jansen-Westerhof - Sun-Wang                39 - 61
          Lévy-Mari - Berkowitz-Letizia              55 - 45
          Chagas-Branco - Leufkens-Westra            46 - 54
          Meckstroth-Rodwell - Chemla-Perron         61 - 39
          Blakset-Christiansen - Berkowitz-Cohen     40 - 60
          Lauria-Versace - Hackett-Hackett           45 - 55
          Mahmood-Forrester - Buratti-Lanzarotti     43 - 57

After this round, it looked as if the tournament would reach its
surprise climax after all. The big match between the leaders was won
57-43 by the runners-up, who close the gap to 32 only. It remains a
big gap, but it's no longer insurmountable. The Italians' 57 was one
of the highest scores of the round. To win it, you only needed
61. Sun-Wang (v. Jansen-Westerhof) and Meckstroth-Rodwell
(v. Chemla-Perron) both reached this score and thus were joint winners
of the round. Berkowitz-Cohen's 60 against the Danes saw the former
rise from 7th to 4th, whereas Helness-Helgemo stayed firmly in 3rd
spot, winning 58-42 against the Poles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               ROUND 14

         Meckstroth-Rodwell - Blakset-Christiansen    62 - 38
         Berkowitz-Cohen - Chemla-Perron              32 - 68
         Sun-Wang - Hackett-Hackett                   28 - 72
         Leufkens-Westra - Buratti-Lanzarotti         40 - 60
         Martens-Szymanowski- Berkowitz-Letizia       52 - 48
         Lauria-Versace - Jansen-Westerhof            60 - 40
         Lévy-Mari - Helness-Helgemo                  65 - 35
         Mahmood-Forrester - Chagas-Branco            41 - 59

The Hacketts win the round, beating Sun-Wang 72-28 and rising to 3rd
place in the process. The big news however was the second consecutive
defeat for the leaders Zia and Forrester. They lost 41-59 to
Chagas-Branco this time. As Lanzarotti-Buratti won again, 60-40
against Leufkens-Westra this time, they reduced the margin to just 13
imps with one round to play. Everything can happen! Lévy-Mari inflict
a 65-35 defeat on Helness-Helgemo, who thus drop a place.
Berkowitz-Cohen, who came from 7th to 4th in the previous round, are
sent back to 7th place by Chemla-Perron who win 68-32. Meckwell
continue well with another 62.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               ROUND 15

          Blakset-Christiansen - Hackett-Hackett     66 - 34
          Buratti-Lanzarotti - Helness-Helgemo       41 - 59
          Mahmood-Forrester - Martens-Szymanowski    49 - 51
          Chemla-Perron - Jansen-Westerhof           49 - 51
          Leufkens-Westra - Lévy-Mari                41 - 59
          Chagas-Branco - Berkowitz-Letizia          47 - 53
          Meckstroth-Rodwell - Sun-Wang              48 - 52
          Berkowitz-Cohen - Lauria-Versace           57 - 43

The low-scoring last round did not bring the surprise climax that
might have been. Though Martens-Szymanowski did beat Zia and Forrester
51-49, Burati-Lanzarotti could not take advantage of it. They had to
face Helgemo-Helness who had everything to play for. The 59-41 Nordic
victory left the Italians fixed in 2nd place, but saw the two-times
winners from Norway come back to seize the bronze. The Hacketts were
on the receiving end of the highest score of the round: they lost
34-66 to Blakset-Christiansen, the big winners of the round.
Berkowitz-Cohen beat Lauria-Versace 57-43, enough to secure 6th place
because Meckwell lost 48-52.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                        Ladies and Gentlemen,

After another exciting CAP GEMINI World Top bridge event I would like
to take the opportunity and say a few words to you.

First of all I would like to start by complimenting all the players
for their contribution to a thrilling tournament. And, of course and
once again, I want to congratulate the winners, Zia Mahmood and Tony
Forrester on an excellent performance in this very strong field with
only world class players.

As you probably know, the members of the organization always set up a
little sweep stake just before the tournament starts, to predict the
winners. And I remembered last year's Zia Mahmood's speech, here at
this very place, where he was telling us the story of his visit to the
old Pakistani fortune teller. And that fortune teller predicted last
year that two bold guys would win, and at the end he appeared to be
completely right!

Since I would like to win that sweep-stake once, I also visited Zia's
fortune teller, because it was proven last year that the man was a
very reliable guy.  And I asked the old man: "Dear fortune teller,
this year we have a very strong field as always, but we have also a
new partnership in our tournament: Zia and Tony Forrester. They seem
to be such an excellent partnership; can they win the tournament this
year?"

The fortune teller glanced at me - a bit disapproving - and he said:
"excellent partnerships are not always what they look like. I will
tell you a little story about that:

Once there were two young married couples, friends of each other. And
to the outside world they looked excellent and model partnerships...
But in an unthinking moment the woman of one pair started a romantic
but secret affair with the man of the other pair. At a particular
night, just when they were in the middle of a very special romantic
moment -you can imagine what you want- the telephone rang.....

The woman answered the telephone and listened and said: "Oh yes of
course dear, I understand, have a nice time; see you later!"

"Who was that?" her amorous friend asked. And she said: "Oh, nothing.
It was my husband. He will be home very late because he is in the
middle of an exciting tennis match that he is playing with you..."

So I understood this message from the old and wise man and for the
sweep-stake I chose another pair as the potential winners of this
tournament and I moved Zia and Tony somewhat to the back... I do not
know what you paid that old man to fool me, Zia! But this fortune
teller of yours appeared to be a crook!

And who did win the sweep-stake? We will hear that later this evening!

Ladies and gentlemen, as every year I am impressed by everybody's
dedication and excellent contributions in the organizational team. Let
it be clear: without their great professionalism and their warm
hearted enthusiasm it would be impossible to organize this fine
tournament. Furthermore, and I am repeating this every year as well, I
owe very much the ladies and gentlemen of the NBB (Dutch Bridge
Federation) for another excellent job. Everybody, from tournament
directors to Vugraph commentators and from Bulletin team to scorers
and runners: thank you all very much!

And of course: I must not forget the support we receive every year
from our sponsors. We have already had a limited number of outside
sponsors for many years and I am very grateful for their continuous
support, but the main part of the costs of this tournament has already
been covered for 10 years by the various divisions within CAP GEMINI.
I think I can say on behalf of the whole bridge world: Thank you very
much for keeping this "Wimbledon of Bridge" as it is called, alive for
so many years!

Last but not least I thank also our special guest during this
tournament, WBF president Mr. José Damiani for his presence, interest
and contribution. Mr.  Damiani: thank you very much.

I will not make this speech too long and as always I want to express
my special gratitude to the hospitality ladies Antoinette, Riet, Suze
and Franca for another excellent job. Ladies, please come forward.
Ladies, once again, thank you very much for your contribution and here
are some nice flowers to confirm our gratitude.

Furthermore my right and left hand in the organization: Emmy van
Strien and - new this year - Dorien Slot; ladies please come forward:
my sincere gratitude for all you have done!

Finally, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a tradition as well, to
hand over a nice little souvenir to all players, officials and
sponsors.  The same artist that designed the little bronze art-work
last year, took - about - the same picture and made, particulary for
us, a very special art-work in glass. At the end of the dinner, after
dessert, our hospitality ladies will hand over the complete tournament
documentation, as well as the art-souvenir and I hope it will get a
special place in your heart and house.

Once again, I thank everybody for their contributions and I truly hope
to see you all back for the next edition of this wonderful event.

Thank you !

        BRIDGE FOR TIRED PEOPLE

In the last round on Saturday night, sometimes the
players feel a little tired.  This is what you
should keep in mind when reading on.

On the first board, Jeff Meckstroth as South
declared 3 NT against Lévy-Mari and was unlucky
enough to have Lévy on lead with the attractive
heart suit.}

definitely board 9.

        WEST       NORTH       EAST      SOUTH
       Burati    Forrester  Lanzarotti    Zia
                    3\C        pass       pass
        pass

Of course this wasn't thr real auction!

There was a slight problem with the equipment at the
start of the match - the first board on VuGraph is
always number 9 - and there was no microphone
connection.  As you will read below, there were
several "numbers" on the deal and the Italians' +50
gave them 6 more valuable imps.}

Imagine him bidding a grand slam on the very last
board.  It all depends on a finesse.  He makes the
vital play, the finesse loses.  He rises slowly
from the table and starts to walk away.  As the
camera pans back he turns for a moment and delivers
the film's closing line:  "I'll be back".(If you
are of a certain age imagine it's Clarke Gable and
the line is "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damm!"
Or perhaps one that was made for a bridge movie,
Humphrey Bogart saying, "Play it again Sam".  Of
course if you are our age it's Charlie Chaplin -
and the rest is silence.)

Arni is still a winner because he, like all the
gladiators here, is certain of one thing - his
desire to compete again in the World's Number One
Bridge Tournament.

Today's opening round witnessed the confrontation
that might have decided everything when the pairs
lying first and second met each other on Vugraph.
The boards looked dull, but at this stage every
deal can turn out to be a rattlesnake just waiting
to strike.}

{At yet another table, the contract was defeated,
but in the end the Appeals Committee awarded +420.
What had happened?

North opened 1\S and South responded 2 NT, limit
raise or strong.  North relayed with 3\C (giving no
information as to his own holding) and South went
to 4\S straight away.  East led a club and West,
after long hesitation, put in the \C10.  Now, when
declarer won and led his diamond, East was quick to
hop up with his Ace and continue a club to
partner's Ace.  The \HA and another led to
declarer's provisional downfall.

The TD was called and the situation was explained
to him.  The first question to be considered is
whether it is obvious for East to take the \DA
straight away if he does not have the unauthorised
information that partner probably holds the \CA.
As you can see from the play at the Vugraph table,
it is by no means certain that East's play of the
DA is automatic.  So the TD changed the result into
4\S just making.  The decision was later upheld by
the Appeals Committee.}

diamonds right and discard your losing club.  You
ruff a club and as the cards lie can exit from

find a winning line by playing off the Ace and King

The last round proved to be something of an
anti-climax as the players were faced by a quiet
set of boards with little scope for swings.  As
usual we were trying to be in eight places at once,
both with pen and camera, but just like a player
having an off day, our timing was a little bit out!

We nearly caught Larry Cohen reading the bulletin
while dummy, but you'll have to take our word for
it.  We did spot this amusing play by Marcelo
