                12th Cap Gemini World Top Tournament 1998

An Invitational Pairs Tournament of Bridge          15-18 January 1998

                         THE OPENING CEREMONY

On the third Thursday of any new year, at 6 p.m., a tradition is
observed in Hotel Des Indes. A well-selected group of bridge players
from all over the world gathers to listen to the friendly words
addressed to them by Henk van Dalen, the Chairman of the Organizing
Committee of the CAP GEMINI World Top Tournament, when he fulfills his
yearly pleasant duty of presenting all the players to the attending
guests. While drinks are graciously offered to everybody, one of the
distinguished guests is invited to come forward to officially open the
tournament. This year, this distinguished guest was Mr Frank de Grave,
the Dutch Deputy Minister of Social Services.

In his opening speech, Mr De Grave made a wonderful tribute to the
players when he confessed how proud he was about having been asked to
come here to open the tournament. For him, a keen bridge player (a
"Berliner," like John Kennedy) himself, there is no tournament like
the CAP GEMINI in this country. There are many very good tournaments,
but this one will remain the most prestigious event.  What is more, no
other tournament organiser will feel insulted by this statement. After
explaining the many reasons why a bridge player cannot possibly be
Politically Correct, the main requirement for any politician nowadays,
he wished all of us a pleasant stay in The Hague and a good and
successful tournament.

                  STANDINGS AFTER THE FIRST 3 ROUNDS

                   1   Helness - Helgemo         190
                   2   Jansen - Westerhof        184
                   3   Chagas - Branco           171
                   4   Chemla - Perron           163
                   5   Buratti - Lanzarotti      160
                   6   Mahmood - Forrester       158
                   7   Lauria - Versace          153
                       Blakset - Christiansen    153
                   9   Berkowitz - Cohen         151
                  10   Meckstroth - Rodwell      150
                  11   Lévy - Mari               144
                  12   Martens - Szymanowski     133
                  13   Leufkens - Westra         128
                  14   Sun - Wang                123
                       Hackett - Hackett         123
                  16   Berkowitz - Letizia       116

If you look at the recent history of this event, you will see that
Helgemo-Helness from Norway have won twice. They did it in 1994 and
1996, so if this even year victory rhythm continues they are bound to
do it again this time.  In this respect, the standings after the first
day can be considered a good omen for them. Their 190 certainly is not
a very big score, but it's already enough to go to the top. In second
spot the home crowd will be pleased to find the first Dutch pair:
Jansen-Westerhof won three matches and finished on 184, well ahead of
Chagas-Branco, the defending champions, who settle for 171 and are
third. No less than seven more pairs are on or over average, from
Chemla-Perron down to Meckwell. Both ladies pairs did not have a
confident start, and Leufkens-Westra again disappointed their local
fans.

                         YESTERDAY'S RESULTS

                                ROUND 1

        Meckstroth-Rodwell - Berkowitz-Letizia         52 - 48
        Berkowitz-Cohen - Helness-Helgemo              37 - 63
        Hackett-Hackett - Mahmood-Forrester            42 - 58
        Buratti-Lanzarotti - Lauria-Versace            56 - 44
        Martens-Szymanowski - Blakset-Christiansen     59 - 41
        Jansen-Westerhof - Leufkens-Westra             66 - 34
        Lévy-Mari - Chemla-Perron                      38 - 62
        Chagas-Branco - Sun-Wang                       55 - 45

In the first round, players from the same country have to meet
whenever possible. Thus, a number of matches deciding national (or
even local) prestige are being played. This time, we had four of them:
an Italian, a French, an American and a Dutch table. Not surprisingly,
the highest margin was reached at the Dutch table (yes, the hosts have
a reputation for sportsmanship!), when Jansen-Westerhof beat
Leufkens-Westra 66-34 to take the lead. The French also made it a
match, Chemla-Perron winning 62-38 against Lévy-Mari. The only other
score of over 60 was recorded by the Norwegians Helgemo-Helness: 63-37
against Berkowitz-Cohen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ROUND 2

           Berkowitz-Letizia - Mahmood-Forrester    44 - 56
           Sun-Wang - Blakset-Christiansen          35 - 65
           Lauria-Versace - Chemla-Perron           52 - 48
           Meckstroth-Rodwell - Hackett-Hackett     58 - 42
           Berkowitz-Cohen - Jansen-Westerhof       38 - 62
           Helness-Helgemo - Leufkens-Westra        67 - 33
           Buratti-Lanzarotti - Lévy-Mari           47 - 53
           Chagas-Branco - Martens-Szymanowski      73 - 27

Chagas-Branco, last year's winners, had already made a good
start. They followed this with the best score in round 2: a 73-27
victory against Martens-Szymanowski. As Helness-Helgemo also just beat
their previous score by beating Leufkens-Westra 67- 33, the Norwegians
moved into the lead by just 2 V.P. over the Brazilians. Another pair
in the sixties was Blakset-Christiansen, who scored 65-35 against
Sun-Wang. Jansen-Westerhof also scored another good win, 62-38 against
Berkowitz-Cohen, and stayed joint second. Two Franco-Italian matches
did not bring many fireworks, the net result being 101-99 to France.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ROUND 3

           Blakset-Christiansen - Lévy-Mari         47 - 53
           Lauria-Versace - Chagas-Branco           57 - 43
           Meckstroth-Rodwell - Helness-Helgemo     40 - 60
           Berkowitz-Cohen - Berkowitz-Letizia      76 - 24
           Hackett-Hackett - Leufkens-Westra        39 - 61
           Sun-Wang - Buratti-Lanzarotti            43 - 57
           Chemla-Perron - Martens-Szymanowski      53 - 47
           Jansen-Westerhof - Mahmood-Forrester     56 - 44

According to Mr Frank de Grave, Berkowitz-Cohen's 76-24 win against
Berkowitz-Letizia was politically correct in bridge: the King is of
higher rank than the Queen. Anyway, it was more than enough to win the
round, as only two other pairs managed just 60. They were
Leufkens-Westra with 61-39 against the Hackett twins, and the leaders
from Norway against Meckwell, 60-40.  Chagas-Branco lost 43-57 to
Lauria-Versace and the latter's fellow countrymen got the same score
against Sun-Wang. Jansen-Westerhof also did well again with 56-44
against Zia and Forrester.}

        UNDER ORDERS

Shortly after attending to the formality of opening
this year's tournament, Henk van Dalen issued his
instructions to the bulletin team:  "Plenty of
humour, please".

So, where to start?  Obviously at the table of the
arch showman, Zia Mahmood.  However, on the first
board it was his partner, Tony Forrester, who
injected a lighter note into the proceedings.}

diamond. Zia wins and unblocks the spades before
playing a heart to the nine. The ninth trick will
come from either hearts or clubs, depending on what
the defenders do.
Of course, Zia was not the only one who did not
believe in miracles and he put up dummy's ten. That

In Round 1, Chagas-Branco from Brazil were
scheduled to play Sun Ming and Wang Hong Li from
China.  The match ended with a small advantage to
the Brazilians (55-45), but the two really giant

heart followed by ducking two rounds of clubs and

        SWINGS AND ROUNDABOUTS

            By Barry Rigal

In Round 2, on paper the encounter between last
year's winners and the pair finishing third looked
like a promising match.  It turned out, however,
that Chagas-Branco judged all the big boards
somewhat better than their opponents, and as a
result they achieved a big victory (73-27).}

{Elsewhere, the 3\D preempt in first seat caused
havoc. Where Helness overcalled 3 NT it allowed NS
to play 4 NT. Westra led a low diamond to the Jack
- and Helness found the fine play of ducking. Now a
diamond to the 10 and ace and a third diamond
allowed Helness to establish the spades by
finessing into the safe hand.}
{But where Sun doubled 3\D Wang drove her to a slam
and Christiansen found the Lightner double to beat
6\S two on the club ruffs.} {Meckstroth-Rodwell also played 6\S doubled, down
two after Jason had opened 3\D.} DQ DT

read the club position but +800 was still a 10-imp

diamond declarer will no doubt duck - now the
defence does best to shift to a club.  If declarer
takes this and leads a spade to dummy to play a
heart, East must take the ace to return the \C8.
