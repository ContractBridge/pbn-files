Halway through this long Saturday, the tournament looks all over
already. Zia Mahmood and Tony Forrester, a new partnership, have
increased their lead to a seemingly unassailable 88 V.P. by scoring an
incredible 233 over the session.  Jansen-Westerhof and
Buratti-Lanzarotti, who both scored average, maintain their positions
as 2nd and 3rd, but the margin between them and the three pairs who
are chasing them has grown considerably narrower. The Hacketts did
well by scoring 187 and rise from 8th to 4th now; the same score sees
Berkowitz-Cohen rise from 9th to 5th. Martens-Szymanowski score just
173 and rise from 7th to 6th, but they suddenly are very much in the
hunt as well. The main disappointment: Helgemo-Helness who with 131
for the session sink from 4th to 7th. Lower down the table,
Blakset-Christiansen and Leufkens-Westra managed 149 and 148, just
under average, but Chemla-Perron (101) and Sun-Wang (97) certainly did
not do well.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                       This Afternoon's Results

                                ROUND 7

          Hackett-Hackett - Chemla-Perron            61 - 39
          Berkowitz-Letizia - Buratti-Lanzarotti     27 - 73
          Leufkens-Westra - Martens-Szymanowski      36 - 64
          Jansen-Westerhof - Blakset-Christiansen    46 - 54
          Mahmood-Forrester - Lévy-Mari              68 - 32
          Helness-Helgemo - Chagas-Branco            27 - 73
          Meckstroth-Rodwell - Lauria-Versace        57 - 43
          Berkowitz-Cohen - Sun-Wang                 62 - 38

The winners of the round were Chagas-Branco, who beat Helness-Helgemo
73-27.  They shared honours with Buratti-Lanzarotti who reached the
same score against Berkowitz-Letizia. Zia-Forrester reached 68-32
against Lévy-Mari and thus stayed in the lead, but only just. Good
scores also for Martens- Szymanowski (64-36 against Leufkens-Westra),
Berkowitz-Cohen (62-38 against Sun-Wang) and the Hacketts (61-39
against Chemla-Perron). Jansen-Westerhof lost narrowly (46-54) to
Blakset-Christiansen and dropped back a little, while the latter might
well have started a recovery. In the remaining match, Meckwell beat
Versace-Lauria 57-43.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ROUND 8

         Sun-Wang - Mahmood-Forrester                 12 - 88
         Hackett-Hackett - Chagas-Branco              71 - 29
         Buratti-Lanzarotti - Jansen-Westerhof        39 - 61
         Leufkens-Westra - Lauria-Versace             38 - 62
         Blakset-Christiansen - Berkowitz-Letizia     71 - 29
         Lévy-Mari - Berkowitz-Cohen                  37 - 63
         Helness-Helgemo - Chemla-Perron              70 - 30
         Meckstroth-Rodwell - Martens-Szymanowski     36 - 64

Round 8 was the highest-scoring round we have seen for a long time
here in the Hague. Zia-Forrester increased their lead to 53 V.P. by
crushing the Chinese 88-12. Blakset-Christiansen
(v. Berkowitz-Letizia) and the Hacketts (v.  Chagas-Branco) both
registered 71-29. The most peculiar score occurred bewteen
Helness-Helgemo and Chemla-Perron: 70-36. The explanation is simple
once you think of it: both pairs were awarded 3 imps for the
misduplicated board 20. The biggest setback of the round was for
Buratti-Lanzarotti, who lost 39-61 to Jansen-Westerhof. This left
these two pairs sharing the runners-up spot.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ROUND 9

         Mahmood-Forrester - Blakset-Christiansen     77 - 23
         Helness-Helgemo - Lauria-Versace             34 - 66
         Jansen-Westerhof - Lévy-Mari                 42 - 58
         Sun-Wang - Berkowitz-Letizia                 47 - 53
         Chemla-Perron - Leufkens-Westra              26 - 74
         Meckstroth-Rodwell - Chagas-Branco           56 - 44
         Buratti-Lanzarotti - Berkowitz-Cohen         38 - 62
         Martens-Szymanowski - Hackett-Hackett        45 - 55

Another resounding win for Forrester and Zia, 77-23 against the Danes,
keeps them clearly at the top of the standings. At last, the Dutch can
cheer for Leufkens-Westra who beat Chemla-Perron 74-26. In the other
match between the Netherlands and France, Lévy-Mari have the edge on
Jansen-Westerhof 58-42. The latter stay in second place, however, as
Lanzarotti-Buratti go down 38-62 to Berkowitz-Cohen. Another defeat,
34-66 against Lauria-Versace, sees Helness-Helgemo drop back to 7th
place and also lose direct contact with the five pairs ahead of
them. The ladies match was won by the USA, but by only 53-47.
} {----------------------------------------------------------------------

        NO ENGLISH, PLEASE

In Round 5, the runners-up at the time,
Lanzarotti-Buratti from Italy, had to face
Chemla-Perron from France.  At the same time, the
other pairs from France and Italy also met, so once
again, the language spoken at two tables would
certainly not be official.  The match between
Lévy-Mari and Lauria-Versace ended in a narrow win
for the French, but at the other table, the
Italians did much better.}

leave one spade in dummy. Now, when you lead a
diamond to dummy after drawing trumps this must be
ducked, as before, but now you can ruff the spade

lead clubs in the three-card ending.}

        A LITTLE LEARNING

Very few defenders practice the art of
"Sitzfleisch" (sitting quietly and waiting for the
opponents to make a mistake) although it is a
recognised Chess strategy.  At Bridge, passive
defence can often equate to that, but as the
results indicate, Board 2 was a hand where that
proved too tough for the field.}

the day, players tend to make a few more mistakes
than they are used to.  In the afternoon session
