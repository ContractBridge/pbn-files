Tension mounts as the tournament reaches its final stages. Zia and
Forrester muster a meagre 127 during the evening session, so their
lead is reduced to only 46 VP. Jansen- Westerhof do even worse,
scoring only 114 and dropping to 7th place. They thus give room to
Buratti-Lanzarotti to rise to 2nd place. Mind you: today's first match
will be between Zia-Forrester and Lanzarotti-Buratti. The Hacketts and
Berklowitz-Cohen also score 140 each and both drop a place. Better
news from the home front: Leufkens-Westra win the evening session with
198 VP and are approaching average. Helgemo-Helness also recover well;
their 195 brings them back into 3rd place. Chagas-Branco have yet
another good session: 179 is enough to greet them again as 4th. Their
score was equalled by Meckwell, who are just over average as well
now. Finally, it's a pity to see the ladies both very much down the
table now, Sun-Wang having a disastrous day of 195 overall.

                     Yesterday Evening's Results

                               ROUND 10

          Helness-Helgemo - Mahmood-Forrester        65 - 35
          Meckstroth-Rodwell - Jansen-Westerhof      68 - 32
          Hackett-Hackett - Berkowitz-Cohen          46 - 54
          Chemla-Perron - Sun-Wang                   59 - 41
          Martens-Szymanowski- Buratti-Lanzarotti    28 - 72
          Leufkens-Westra - Berkowitz-Letizia        61 - 39
          Lauria-Versace - Blakset-Christiansen      40 - 60
          Chagas-Branco - Lévy-Mari                  33 - 67

The main news from this round was that Zia-Forrester lost 35-65 to
Helgemo-Helness. The first to profit from this result were
Buratti-Lanzarotti who won the round with 72-28 against
Martens-Szymanowski. So the Italians moved into second place, only 55
VP behind the leaders. Meckstroth-Rodwell beat Jansen-Westerhof 68-32,
so the latter sank from 2nd to 5th. A good round also for Lévy-Mari,
67-33 against Chagas-Branco saw the latter disappear under
average. Three pairs lower down the table (Chemla-Perron,
Leufkens-Westra and Blakset-Christiansen) also scored about 60 apiece,
so their scores look a bit more honourable now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               ROUND 11

          Chemla-Perron - Mahmood-Forrester          49 - 51
          Martens-Szymanowski- Jansen-Westerhof      41 - 59
          Helness-Helgemo - Sun-Wang                 74 - 26
          Berkowitz-Letizia - Lauria-Versace         55 - 45
          Blakset-Christiansen - Leufkens-Westra     32 - 68
          Meckstroth-Rodwell - Buratti-Lanzarotti    49 - 51
          Berkowitz-Cohen - Chagas-Branco            31 - 69
          Lévy-Mari - Hackett-Hackett                56 - 44

Both leading pairs won, Zia-Forrester against Chemla-Perron and
Buratti-Lanzarotti against Meckwell. Both winning scores were 51-49,
so the margin between the first two pairs remained on 55. The round
was won by Helgemo-Helness by beating Sun-Wang 74-26. Two more good
wins came from Chagas-Branco with 69-31 against Berkowitz-Cohen who
thus went down three places, and from Leufkens-Westra with 68-32
against Blakset-Christiansen. As the Hacketts also lost, 44-56 against
Lévy-Mari, Helgemo-Helness rise to third again, 21 behind the
runners-up and just 7 ahead of Jansen-Westerhof who scored a useful 59
against the Poles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               ROUND 12

          Jansen-Westerhof - Chagas-Branco           23 - 77
          Leufkens-Westra - Sun-Wang                 69 - 31
          Berkowitz-Letizia - Chemla-Perron          41 - 59
          Meckstroth-Rodwell - Lévy-Mari             62 - 38
          Martens-Szymanowski- Berkowitz-Cohen       45 - 55
          Buratti-Lanzarotti - Hackett-Hackett       50 - 50
          Blakset-Christiansen - Helness-Helgemo     44 - 56
          Lauria-Versace - Mahmood-Forrester         59 - 41

The day's final round is won by Chagas-Branco, who add to
Jansen-Westerhof's misery by inflicting another big defeat, 77-23, on
them. Leufkens-Westra do well again, winning 69-31 against
Sun-Wang. The only other score of over 60 goes to Meckwell, 62-38
against Lévy-Mari. At the top of the standings, Buratti-Lanzarotti tie
with the Hacketts (50-50) and thus recoup only 9 VP as Zia-Forrester
lose again, 41-59 this time against Lauria-Versace. The Nordic derby
is won by the Norwegians, 56-44 against their oldest rivals. Useful
scores also to Chemla-Perron, 59-41 against Berkowitz-Letizia, and
Berkowitz-Cohen 55-45 against the Poles.

{Board 17 was the freak of the set.
At most tables the North hand passed, letting South
get into his opponents' natural auction to show a
massive two-suiter.  Normal defence against a club
contract held it to ten tricks, and the field was
split between those who had exercised enough
discretion to stop at the four-level and those who
had pushed on to 5\D.
However, at two tables North opened 2\H (to show a
two-suiter).  When Westra did this, Leufkens jumped
to 3 NT and Versace as West tried 4\D, doubled
hungrily by Westra.}

{An extraordinary number of imps were riding on the
club suit on the next board.
Six of the eight tables managed to bid the NS cards
to slam, and 6\C is about exactly 50%.  The problem
was to guess who would have the long trumps.  There
is very little opportunity to find out about the
hand, particularly if East is on lead and suggests
long spades.
In fact the only two declarers to succeed were the
two Scandinavian pairs.  Søren Christiansen as
North made it on a spade lead (well guessed)}

        ON FALSECARDING

Themistocles Papadopoulos, the favourite opponent
of Victor Mollo's immortal Hideous Hog, was reputed
to be the only man capable of false-carding with a
singleton.  Alas for a number of declarers in the
ninth round, there were several opponents who
seemed equally capable of the feat!} {Seven out of
eight declarers reached 6\H (the Hackets being the
distinctly fortunate exceptions).  As you can see
the slam is laydown if trumps split; but when
declarer laid down a top trump the nine appeared.
Now the question is whether it is a singelton or
the "standard" false-card from J9xx.  Larry Cohen
(playing against Buratti-Lanzarotti) and Lisa
