{
If West's 1S opening is normal in the partnership style, then
East's raise to game was perhaps a bit of a stretch - at matchpoints
anyway. 4S spades requires quite a lot of luck, and today was
not the day. Fortunately, it was over in a hurry when a diamond
was led to the ace, heart to the ace, heart ruff. When the short
trump hand turned out to have scored the ruff, there was no more
trump guess. 4S went two down, plus 200 for NS.

{
East-West had no trouble reaching their best spot by straightforward
bidding. North will likely make eight tricks in spades but it's
doubtful whether any NS pairs will bid on to 3S at this vulnerability
and risk the kiss of death (otherwise known as down one versus
a partial). Declarer was saved a (not too difficult) club guess,
and the same may be said for the hearts. Thereafter he had no
problem collecting nine tricks, losing only two trump tricks
and the rounded suit aces. 3D made three, minus 110 to NS.

{
Notice Levy's choice of third seat opening bid - not Canapé.
1D rather than 1C affords an easy rebid, unless one is prepared
to bid 1NT over a 1H response or 2S over a 1S response. Rebidding
2C after having opened 1C simply does not look good. Secondly,
should the opponents buy the contract, a diamond lead would be
preferable. Furthermore, the diamond fit was discovered immediately
at the table. Mind you, notrump wouldn't be bad, but 1NT should
go down after a spade lead by West (or - unlikely - by East,
provided West ducks the first round!).

{
West's 3C preempt gave South a serious problem. Hope springs
eternal, however. Counting on short clubs and wishing for relatively
short diamonds opposite, South was hopeful that a suitable major
contract could be found. When partner was doubled in 3D, he redoubled
for rescue, which led to the doubled 3S contract in the 4-3 spade
fit.

{
Would anyone open the bidding on any of these hands at any table?
West has the tough decision to make. The rule of sixteen (number
of HCP plus number of spades held) says 'no'. Others use the
rule of fifteen, and the answer would be 'yes'. I would (the
good diamonds spots being a factor, and besides, I come to play),
and it would work out nicely, too! 1NT is a lovely contract,
with the diamonds lying favorably.

{
Chemla and Levy apparently do not use a negative double in this
situation to distinguish between a four-card and five-card spade
holding. Nor did Chemla, South, use a support double when he
had a chance. Although 3C is not a bad spot for NS (whether it
makes or not), it certainly was hard to bid.

{
The Bulgarian East-West had a sound auction to a sound small
slam in hearts. The only strange item was West's 5S response
to 4NT Roman Key Card Blackwood, ostensibly showing two aces
and the queen of trumps (as if spades were the agreed trump suit).
However, this was of no consequence - or was it? Declarer was
one trick away from making his contract when, at Trick eight,
he tried to ruff the wrong minor suit card and was overruffed
by North, who administered the 'coup de grace' by removing dummy's
last trump.

{
Although NS did not compete further after West's 1S overcall,
it's not very likely they would have been allowed to play a low
diamond partscore. West has enough extra values not to get frozen
out (for example, double, if South rebids 2D, uhhh!) and East
would bid a quiet 2S. 3D doubled could go for 300

Bidding from outer space, one would think. Actually, it was Poland,
