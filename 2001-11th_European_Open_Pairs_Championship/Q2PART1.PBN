{
Our featured pair for this set are Wojciech Olanski and Michel
Kwiecien of Poland. Kwiecien is the current World Open Pairs
holder (with Jacek Pszczola) and Olanski has represented his
native Poland internationally on several occasions. We begin
with a borderline decision for our N/S pair. Kwiecien's methods
were Polish Club (12-14 balanced, 19-22 any, or 12-18 and five-plus
clubs). His hand was prime, but was below strength for a 1C opening.
North reversed, but the auction petered out. The pair bid naturally
to 4H without so much as a sniff at slam.

{
In third seat, Crawford opened the West hand with a weak notrump.
It was within his range, but the hand appears very suit-oriented.
This effort lost the club suit for E/W, and it was certainly
difficult for them to go to the four-level after this start.
If the DA and HK were both onside, declarer could actually take
eleven tricks with clubs as trump. North entered the auction
with a major-suit takeout 2C, and East made an attempt to play
in 3C with a Lebensohl 2NT advance. Olanski bid 3S, and no one
had anything more to say.

{
Olanski started proceedings with his three-way club, and the
1H response showed at least four hearts and eight-plus HCP. East,
feeling she was within a couple of tricks of making her contract,
tried 4S. A tad aggressive given the prevailing vulnerability.
North had little choice other than doubling, as too much room
had been taken from N/S to allow an intelligent investigation.
N/S can make five of either minor, so they would have to defeat
4S doubled two tricks to garner a good matchpoint score.

{
Kwiecien opened his three-way club, and Olanski's 2D bid showed
at least five diamonds and at least eight HCP. Both 2S and 3C
were natural, but 3H was, more or less, a fourth-suit probe.
He had denied four hearts with the 2S bid. East doubled (to convince
herself to lead hearts?), and this ran back around to North,
who bid 3NT to show some doubt. He didn't bid 3NT directly after
3C, so this effort denoted a single heart stopper. This ended
the auction, and East led the S4 to dummy's queen.

{
South's 3D jump shift was along the lines of an intermediate
hand-type. Hands containing nineteen-plus HCP would be opened
with 1C, so this denoted a maximum of eighteen. North, appreciating
his great values (singleton DQ and two aces) requested good trumps
with his 5H call. South was happy to comply with his robust suit.
In fact, those heart spots would prove to be quite useful in
the play. West found the trump lead - a spade lead would likely
set declarer - and dummy's jack was allowed to hold the first
trick. Declarer embarked on a cross-ruff to land his contract.

{
E/W conducted a perfectly natural auction to the best spot. On
a good day, one would want to be in 6D. This would require the
club finesse onside, and no foul breaks. The club hook was offside,
and the diamonds broke ... well, not very well. Once E/W safely
landed in the notrump game, they were destined to score an average
plus. As long as declarer timed the play properly. North found
the obvious spade lead to the queen, king, and ace. The DK brought
the nasty news in that suit.

{
The natural auction (forcing notrump) had West intervening with
2D. Partner's HK was just enough to allow this contract to make
when the D10 drops harmlessly on the first round of the suit.
Declarer would lose two spades, one heart, one diamond, and one
club. A 2D contract was never going to see the light of day,
and N/S alighted in 2S. The club suit never received a mention.
With careful play N/S should be able to make 3C, but that was
neither here nor there, as declarer had to land at least eight
tricks in spades for a decent matchpoint score.

{
West's 1D opener in third seat was dictated by the five-card
major base, and North actively intervened with 2C. Definitely
a matchpoint call designed to take some room from the opponents.
Would Kwiecien have bid this at IMPs, I wonder? East's negative
double was a bit out of kilter, as she would be forced into bidding
notrump at the two or three level if partner introduced hearts.
Certainly not the end of the world. In any event, partner dutifully
bid spades, and East invited game with 3S. West had an easy pass
with her modest collection.

West's strong notrump had Kwiecien actively bidding once again.
His lack of "hand" didn't deter him, and he was right there with
a 2H overcall. East's 3S was forcing to game as he had other
Lebensolish actions available to him. South's 4C had fit and
lead connotations, and West announced her suitability with a
4H cue-bid. East had no slam aspirations, and settled quietly
in 4S. If E/W had stopped off to double 4H, they would have netted
plus 500 if they defended accurately. They can hold declarer
to five hearts, one diamond and one club.

The natural auction had E/W fetch up in a normal 1NT contract.
Note that N/S hold all four nines, and that these fairly innocuous
cards would play a huge role for the defense. North was, in effect,
endplayed at trick one, and chose to broach the spade suit. His
S2 lead went to the ten and queen. The CJ was covered by the
queen, king, and ace, and South's C9 had grown. After the spades
were cleared, declarer started on diamonds. South played the
DK on the first round, which gave North's D9 more power.

{
Kwiecien's three-way club posed a problem for East. He decided
that a takeout double was in order to get the major suits involved.
His lack of diamond support notwithstanding. Olanski's natural
1D avoided any danger of an accident - playing 1C doubled. Now,
West had a problem. He solved it with a value-oriented 2NT call.
He presumed partner had some filling in the diamond suit for
his takeout double. East more than made up for that with club
filling. N/S's system had pushed E/W to a reasonable contract.

{
East's hand is an advertisement for the 1NT vs major-suit opening
brigade. Our French pair obviously are of the mind that one opens
the major when holding this hand-type. No right or wrong - just
philosophy. The natural invitational auction wound it's way inexorably
towards 3NT. After some of Kwiecien's overcalling exploits this
round, one can't help thinking he might have been there with
a 2C overcall on the South cards! In any case, E/W would have
ended in 3NT despite any intervention.

Overbids by West (with poor values even for a non-vul passed-hand

support for his double-jump to game) landed East-West in the
soup. When North doubled greedily for a likely one-trick set,
South misread it as takeout double and pulled to five clubs.
That couldn't be right, for a takeout double is inconsistent
with North's mere two clubs earlier.
