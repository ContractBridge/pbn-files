lead that would beat three notrump.

{
It seems normal enough for North, with his balanced hand, secondary
diamond stength and only three small spades, to bid one notrump
in reply to South's one-spade overcall of East's one diamond.
However, there's something to be said for raising to two spades:
one notrump lets East bid two clubs and perhaps compete successfully.
The play in four clubs could get very interesting on a SK lead,
but East passed cautiously, and South's two spades bought the
contract.

South's one-club was strong and artificial; West's double was
a takeout for the majors. After South showed long clubs and North
supported, it was only a question of which would bid three notrump
and when.

North's one-spade response to South's big-club opening showed
three controls (A=2, K=1); North's two clubs over South's natural
one-notrump rebid asked for four-card suits up the line. The
artificial opening and response made North, rather than South,
declarer in four spades. Might that make a difference in the
play, and if so, in whose favor?

{
What price overbidding? North's takeout double of one club was
not only slightly off-shape but a bit light. South's two-club
cue bid triggered the bidding of suits up the line. Then, just
when a fit was found, the bidding died. Standard expert practice
is for the cue bid to be forcing at least to suit agreement,
but North, perhaps ashamed of her under-strength takeout double,
passed. So the price of North's early overbid was a late underbid
(underpass?) and a missed game.

After North opened a 14-17 HCP notrump, West balanced with a
"Woolsey" double (four-card major, longer minor). East's two
diamonds asked for the major, and South's double said nothing
about diamonds but showed high cards. West might have passed
to show diamonds, but bid two hearts, thus enabling East to compete
to three hearts later.

South's 2C was the limited natural opening usually played by
strong-clubbers, showing either six clubs, or five clubs with
a four-card side suit. North made a weak raise over West's takeout
double. When the opponents reached a vulnerable four spades,
South took a non-vulnerable five-club save. West, with his strong
balanced hand, doubled.

{
South jumped directly to game in response to North's 14-17 notrump,
and was lucky to catch North with a beefy 15, the H10 being key.
East, with two four-card minors from which to lead, chose diamonds.
The suit was right, a good guideline being to lead the suit whose
two highest cards are closest to each other, but the spot-card,
the D10, was too valuable to release. East was lucky to catch
West with good diamond spots, else the D10 would have blown a
trick.

{
What should delayed three-level entry by a player who could have
entered directly over an opposing notrump mean? Most assume that
a bid like East's three clubs shows a hand too weak for the direct
bid (or whatever the player's Notrump Defense dictates for a
strong hand with clubs) earlier. More logical: weak speaks immediately,
strong passes initially in hopes of beating one notrump several.
If so, West, with club help and spades stopped, could convert
to three notrump.

{
In the canape methods of the North-South strong-club system,
North's one spade could be based on four spades and a longer
red suit, so South temporized with one notrump. North's two-club
rebid confirmed a fifth spade, however, for with four spades
and longer clubs, the system opening is two clubs. South took
back to two spades, reaching the same contract that others would
reach with a direct raise.

{
The version of Support Doubles played by East-West permits opener
to double with either three-card support for responder's major
or extra high-card strength. Like other forms of Support Doubles,
East's double gave West a problem when he had only four spades.
I'd have solved it by bidding two notrump, but West bid three
diamonds and was lucky to catch East with a good five-card suit.
