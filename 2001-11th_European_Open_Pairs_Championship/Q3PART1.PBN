{
The featured pair for the third qualifying session is the young
Dutch pair, Simon De Wijs and Bas Drijver, who led the qualifiers
after the first two sessions. They play 2/1 game forcing. Drijver
passed with the North hand, no doubt hoping to show the two-suited
nature of his hand later on, but Zakrzewski had a gadget available
for his hand, and he used it. He opened a Polish 2D, showing
a weak hand with both majors.

{
The no-holds-barred Polish 2D struck again on this board, but
this time Zaremba simply gave preference to spades. Drijver made
a takeout double and the Dutch pair found their diamond fit.
The irrepressible Zakrzewski was not finished on this hand either,
however, and he competed with 3S. His exuberance was understandable,
but why not show the considerable extra heart length by bidding
3H, especially as there was no guarantee that West had at least
four spades.

{
After De Wijs had described his hand, Drijver made a pairs decision
by settling for 3NT rather than 4S. Volhejn led a safe C9, and
Drijver overtook with the king in hand to preserve an entry to
dummy. He then got the spades right by cashing the king and running
the ten.

{
This is clearly a slam that one would want to be in, but without
knowing the nuances of the bidding, it is not clear what when
wrong for E/W. It does seem though that Mraz would have been
better placed if Volhejn had tried 4D instead of 4NT. De Wijs
led a spade against 4NT and declarer won the ace. He tested diamonds
and then ran the minors before taking a losing heart finesse.
Minus 690 and a probable good match point result for N/S.

{
Our featured pair had a useful weapon in their armoury on this
hand. After Cima had overcalled 1H, De Wijs was able to jump
to 3D to show 6+ diamonds and 7-9 HCP. This tempted Drijver into
trying 3NT, a dubious assignment with so many top cards missing.

[Declarer "W"]
{
North had the best hand at the table, but had to sell out to
2S. Clearly making eight tricks is not a problem as the E/W hands
fit very well, so what was at issue was the number of overtricks
West could muster. Drijver led a low club and Stoppa won the
ace and ducked a diamond to North. Drijver continued clubs, so
Stoppa ruffed and played a heart to dummy's jack. He now led
the CJ and when South ruffed (discarding would have been better)
he overruffed. Stoppa now made a small mistake when he continued
with the HK.

{
Some players would double 1D with the South hand, but that is
unnecessary when you have a partner like Drijver to protect you.
He duly doubled 2S and De Wijs bid 3C in comfort. With the CQ
and SA onside there were only four losers and De Wijs scored
plus 110. A good result for our featured pair.

If Tomassini had bid 4C over 2H, he might have made life more

in 4H. After a club lead ruffed and a heart to the king, this
hand is all about what view declarer takes on the second round
of hearts.

{
Drijver responded 1NT to his partner's 1S opening bid (perhaps
he was systemically unable to raise to 2S) and then naturally
competed with 2S after Witak had overcalled 2H. Kowalczyc would
have done well if he had tried 3C (one down on best defence)
in the pass out seat, but instead passed and 2S became the final
contract. West led a heart and East won the king. A trump switch
seems reasonable at this point, and would have held declarer
to eight tricks, but Witak played a club and declarer discarded
a diamond on dummy's ace.

{
Do you or don't you bid Stayman with the East hand? Witak belongs
to the school that doesn't, so he raised to 3NT. North led a
spade and Kowalczyc took the second round and played a diamond
towards the queen. Drijver rose with his king and cleared the
spades. Declarer's next move was to finesse the CJ, a rather
dangerous and premature play. However, you can't argue with success,
and when diamonds broke 3-3 only one heart trick was needed to
fulfill the contract.

Fiorani's 2H rebid suggests that 2C might have been a relay,
but, whatever it meant, E/W clearly knew what they were doing
since they reached the right contract. Drijver led a spade to
the ten and king and Giordano cleared the hearts. De Wijs took
his queen and carefully cashed the DA before returning a spade.
When Drijver took his ace, declarer claimed the rest. Minus 630
looked like an average result.

{
The seemingly natural auction reached the normal 3NT contract
and De Wijs led the S2 to the nine and king. There were now ten

the diamond finesse in order to try for a second overtrick.

{
South's leap to 4S at unfavourable vulnerability on essentially
a flat hand was just too much, especially opposite another flat
hand. If the intention was to goad the opponents to go to the
five level on the strength of extreme shortness in spades, it
backfired badly. West would need to find the DQ to even make
4H. East certainly knew what to do when West allowed him to make
the final decision.
