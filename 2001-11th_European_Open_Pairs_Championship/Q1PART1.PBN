{
The featured pair for this first qualifying session is Dano De
Falco and Guido Ferraro, members of the Italian team that won
the Olympiad in Maastricht last year. That was Ferraro's first
World Championship, but De Falco also won the Bermuda Bowl in
1974. They play a canapé-based strong club system.

Ferraro was not prepared to sell out to 2H, so he made a takeout
double and Piekarek took the push to 3H. With the CK onside,
there was nothing to the play and Gotard made his contract for
the loss of two spades and two diamonds. Minus 140 to N/S. If
Gotard had passed 1NT instead, he could have made the same nine
tricks and taken the contract three down for plus 300, on a heart
lead and a club shift, of course.

Meyer had good controls but no club fit, so he bid 3NT over his
partner's 3C and that ended the auction. De Falco led a small
diamond against 3NT, so Meyer made all thirteen tricks. Minus
720 to N/S. Despite the DQ pulling its weight, the small slam
in clubs is only about even (CQ onside doubleton or tripleton,
or diamonds three-three to pitch the losing heart), so it was
not unreasonable for E/W to stop in game.

{
De Falco's 2C over Meyer's 1NT showed both majors, but his raise
to game over what was likely to be a preemptive 3H from Ferraro
seems dubious. Vandervorst thought he had enough to double 4H,
and Meyer led a club to the queen, king and ace. A heart to the
ten would have enabled Ferraro to escape for one down, but that
was an unlikely play. Instead he played a spade to the queen,
king and ace.

De Falco/Ferraro play good three-level preempts. The North hand

opened the bidding with 3C in third seat. Portuoi had an obvious
3H overcall and Kirilenko a less obvious raise to game.

E/W can make eleven tricks in either red suit as the defense
can take only their two black aces. So Kirilenko made his 5D
and scored his game. But what about N/S? They can make eleven
tricks in spades if declarer guesses clubs correctly, so the
Italians quit too soon.

{
I would have thought the British pair's methods would have allowed
them to show both majors over 1NT, so it seems surprising that
Pryor chose to overcall 2S. Muller raised to 3S, which was the
right level for spades as the cards lay, but the cold 4H went
begging.

{
E/W can make a small slam in hearts or clubs and will probably
get the clubs right, making an overtrick after South's overcall,
but they could have been left to play in 4H - so what went wrong?
Perhaps Muller thought 4H was forward-going whereas Pryor took
it as a sign-off.

{
Cue-bidding and then rebidding 2NT seems about right with the
West hand, but East, with nothing to spare for his original vulnerable
overcall, should probably have passed 2NT. De Falco led a club
against 3NT and Isporski won cheaply with the seven. Playing
North for Q10x of spades appears the only chance of making the
contract, but declarer seemed to have ruled that out halfway
through the play.

{
Ivanchev began with a strong club, but bid conservatively thereafter
and E/W stayed out of the reasonable 4S game. Given the bidding,
declarer would doubtless have come to ten tricks by taking the
winning heart finesse, but Ferraro naturally led his singleton
heart. Declarer won his jack and played three rounds of trumps,
and eventually lost a trump, a club and a diamond for 10 tricks.
Minus 170 for our featured pair.

{
For many players the choice of opening bid on the North hand
may be a toss up between 1S and 2NT (or even 2C, strong). My
preference would be 1S because of the high card concentration
in two suits. De Falco opted for 2C (20-22 balanced, or game
forcing) and after Ferraro's waiting 2D bid he showed his balanced
hand. 3C was Puppet Stayman so that North's 3S bid showed a 5-card
suit. Now, South obviously had to sign off in 3NT, maybe not
altogether confidently in view of his very meagre assets.

When South's 1S opening bid was passed to East, he bid a normal

North could do no better than to bid and rebid his very decent
6-card diamond suit. This was one level too high for real comfort
(as 2H would have been).
