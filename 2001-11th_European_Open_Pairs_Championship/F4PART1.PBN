{
We continue to follow our featured pair in the Final, Marcin
Lesniewski and Krzysztof Martens of Poland. They enter this session
in sixth place, and aren't far off the lead. The first ten pairs
are bunched closely. The North hand was just short of an opening
bid for Lesniewski, and so passed. When Martens opened 1S, North
used a Drury-fit 2C to show approximately 9-11 HCP, and three-card
spade support. Martens's 2S rebid denied a real opening bid,
and the partnership came to rest in a very quiet 2S.

{
E/W were playing Precision, and the 1C bid was strong, and 1D
was weak. North entered with a vulnerable 1S, and East got his
club suit in. South's double was competitive, and West surprisingly
passed with seven diamonds. 2D appears to be a normal action.
When North rebid his spades, East bid his rather poor club suit
a second time naturally. The second Martens double told East
what he thought of the bid. Now West couldn't bid diamonds -
after all, hadn't partner shown an immense club suit?

Lesniewski doubled West's strong notrump - showing at least five-four-plus
in the majors, or a single-suited major. South's 2C was an inquiry
as to which North held. His 2H showed both majors, and there
the partnership rested. Lesniewski is a very aggressive player,
so it was not surprising that a  missing major-suit card should
deter him from entering the auction. He had the vulnerability
on his side, a singleton, and partner fit quite well with his
two aces.

We can see from the layout that E/W can make 6C. You really don't
want to be in that contract, but would be perfectly happy getting
to 5C making six. The HK didn't have to ruff out third (or, failing
that, the DQ ruffing out third or fourth), and the CQ didn't
have to be onside. The natural French auction had some troubles
along the way. North's takeout double might have had some effect
on what transpired, but East's lack of enthusiasm was really
the culprit. His 3D effort was quite feeble given partner's positive
actions.

{
North's 2C opening showed 10-14 HCP, and at least five clubs
with a four-card major, or six-plus clubs. East's double was
a very aggressive stance. He held a 4-3-3-3 aceless thirteen-count,
and really should have remained silent. He could be in serious
jeopardy at the two-level if South held a real hand. East survived
that problem, but couldn't avoid similar aggression from partner.
West jumped to 3H on a poor collection. Possibly, he expected
a "true" takeout double from East.

{
E/W can make 4D. Though if the defense is sloppy, there is some
chance at an overtrick. Not likely though. West chose an interesting
approach with his cards. First, he chose to respond on strength
before length, and then he chose to continue with a non-forcing
2S on his doubleton spade, and ace-king-ace holding. Undoubtedly
he had his eye on a five-two spade-fit that would out-score other
strains. He achieved this, in a manner of speaking. East should
arrive at nine tricks in spades for a score of plus 140.

{
North's double of 2S was in the negative genre, but carried possible
other meanings as a free suit-bid after the 2S intervention would
be a negative-free-bid (non-forcing). Lesniewski liked his hand
well enough to begin with a double. Martens checked for a spade
stopper with his 3S advance, and North tried to conclude the
auction with 4H. The partnership wasn't on firm ground here,
and Martens went to 5D. A very unfortunate situation.

{
The best strain for N/S is diamonds, but they proved elusive
for our featured pair. If E/W take a spade ruff vs diamonds,
declarer has the time to park the losing club on the SQ, and
gets nine tricks. The defense can hold declarer to eight tricks
in diamonds by leading a club. Now, declarer can't get to his
hand fast enough to draw trump. With the club set up, and the
HA entry, E/W take the delayed spade ruff. Here, E/W jockeyed
N/S into a very tenuous four-three spade-fit. The spades were
four-two, and the spots were over declarer.

A real trouble hand for whoever buys the contract. North's 1C
was usually 12-14 HCP balanced (as here), and South's 1NT was
eight-plus HCP and balanced. When this was passed back to East,
he decided to get his majors in action, or so he thought. His
2C was meant as majors, but taken as natural by West. He began
with a 2D advance, and when East moved with 2H, West went back
to the safety of clubs. He thought ace third of clubs was magnificent
support. South knew the wheels had fallen off somewhere as he
held four clubs.

East's strong notrump (14-16 HCP) shut N/S out of the auction
when they were able to take eight tricks in spades. Neither had
a way into the auction, and both are aggressive bidders. E/W
can make the same eight tricks as N/S - in hearts. When West
passed 1NT (normal), they had missed their heart-fit. The S9
lead went to the queen, three, and eight. When declarer cleared
the clubs, Martens uncharacteristically shifted to the D7. What
was it about the first spade trick that made him do that (the
Poles play upside down carding)?

This was everyone's 4S. East got the essential lead-directing

so were sensible to give up at the three-level. In essence what
might have happened is, an E/W 4H bid would simply transfer N/S
to a 4S bid. This often is the case in competitive auctions in
the major-suits.

Lesnieswki felt he was a little short of opening the North hand
with 1D. He was using 2D as a multi-bid, so couldn't go that
route, and 3D didn't appeal to him with the almost solid suit.
When he passed, it allowed East to open a weak-two in spades
that could hold as few as five spades. A bonus that he had six
since he was non-vulnerable vs vulnerable. 2S effectively silenced
Martens, and Lesniewski balanced with 3D in the passout seat.
It was certainly a good thing that N/S had limited their values,
as a 3NT effort would see them fall two tricks short.

N/S came quietly to rest in 2S when East thought he would rather
not defend this contract. A 2H contract by N/S would fail by
one trick, when the defense can arrange to shut the dummy out
with a trump switch by West (as long as he didn't receive a diamond
lead). A 2S contract would also most likely fail by one trick
(CA, heart shift - East will yield a club trick in endgame).
East made up for West's timidity (West might have bid 2D after
1S at matchpoints, though he was probably quite happy he didn't
when North bid diamonds), and balanced with 3C.
