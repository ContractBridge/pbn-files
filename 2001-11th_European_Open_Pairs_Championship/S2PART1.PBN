{
Our featured pair for the second semifinal session are Apolinary
Kowalski and Jacek Romanski of Poland. They have represented
their native country internationally on a number of occasions
with great success. They play Polish Club ... what else? North
began proceedings with a natural 1D, and East doubled, as he
perceived this hand to be just out of his overcall range. South's
1S advance caught a penalty double from West, and North got his
other minor into the mix. This turned out to be a good move as
it directed the winning defense.

{
If East's hand was out of overcall range (on the previous board),
then certainly this North hand was out of range. North began
with a double, and after partner's 1D response jumped to 2S.
As a 1S continuation would show a pretty good hand, this 2S effort
denoted even more strength. It wasn't forcing, but highly forward-going.
South, with trump support, a king, and a ruffing value looked
no further than the spade game. It looks as if a trump lead is
the best start for the defense. However, declarer can embark
on a line of play that will garner eleven tricks anyway.

{
An unlucky board for the Lebensohl convention. E/W have a good
diamond fit, and they would certainly like to come to rest in
3D. However, it isn't that easy. 2S was destined to fail by one
trick, so E/W were looking for a plus score. East doubled the
live auction, and West would have to be prescient to leave this
in. His 2NT advance was Lebensohl, and announced approxiamtely
0-8 HCP. If East held a normal takeout double he was expected
to bid 3C to allow partner to escape to his best suit.

N/S were cold for 4H, but neither one of them had a clearcut
entry into the auction. South would have to make a VERY big bid
after East's game-forcing four-plus spades 2NT advance. Romanski
might have tried it non-vulnerable, but here the chances of a
large penalty loomed. E/W weren't playing scientific responses
to this 2NT advance, and 3S simply showed West's minimum. Maybe
it's just as well that N/S never found their heart fit. They
may have been tempted to take the one-trick sacrifice in 5H.

Kowalski's 2D opening was Multi (weak in either major), and Romanski's
2H advance was pass-or-correct. West, Milo, was caught between
a rock and a hard place holding both majors, and passed. When
Kowalski corrected to 2S, this ran around to Milo who decided
to double now. In his mind, the double may have been penalty-oriented,
but unless specifically discussed as a penalty action, it was
better left on the shelf. If takeout, he could expect to hear
a minor from partner in most cases. Then, what should he do?

{
After Romanski's Polish Club, Kowalski responded with a waiting
1D (usually 0-8 HCP), and 1H announced 12-20 HCP, and at least
three hearts. Indeed, in their system, the 1H bid could contain
a four-card spade suit with only three hearts. The idea is to
key on major-suit lengths as early as possible. Here, Kowalski
was secure in raising this with his marvelous support. It was
surprising that Romanski didn't make any game-try after that
start. But, the matchpoint game is all about plus scores, so
it is understandable opposite a possible 0-8 HCP.

{
Kowalski's 2H opener denoted a weak two-suiter with hearts and
another suit. East hypotheitcal 3H would have asked for a heart
stopper, trying for notrump. This would have been a successful
move forward as West can bid 3NT with his HK. If North leads
a heart, nine tricks. If North leads something else, declarer
can win, and knock out the CA. Amazingly, West's S10 protects
him from the spade switch (if a spade was led), and the H7! protects
him in the heart suit (West covers the HQ switch). With K63 of
hearts he wouldn't bid 3NT - would he?

{
After three passes, West opened 1D, and it was surprising to
see Kowalski pass this at his second turn. I would have thought
that the S10 would sway him towards overcalling 1S on his reasonable
four-card suit at this vulnerability. N/S can make a partscore
in spades, so silence with those cards would cost his side. E/W
exchanged some natural information before alighting in 1NT. Precise
defense can defeat this contract one trick, but this is difficult
to do in practice. Romanski found the good heart lead, and this
went to North's ten.

A light 1S opening had Romanski doubling with half the deck.
His 2NT showed approximately 19-21 HCP, and a balanced hand with
spades stopped. Right on the money. This would be everyone's
3NT, as South would open 2NT if East had passed, and 3NT would
be reached without incident. If South had to intervene after
a weak 2S or a Multi, he could double first, and announce the
extra strength on the next round. In any event, most, if not
all N/S pairs would find their way to 3NT.

{
Kowalski's double of 2H was of the negative persuasion. It showed
a smattering of high-cards, and was takeout. Romanski, with an
eye on the higher scoring strain, bid his chunky three-card spade
suit. He knew he was landing in the Moysian fit, but hoped this
strain was better than a minor-suit fit. I wonder if the minors
could have been implied by a 2NT advance after partner's double?
Then, the partnership could have fetched up in 3C. That would
have been ten easy tricks. Declarer had different problems in
this tenuous fit.

E/W play a similar system base as Bocchi-Duboin, and the 1C opening
was prepatory. The 1H response denoted a positive (eight-plus),
and at least a four-card spade suit. The 1S rebid announced at
least three-card spade support, and 1NT was natural, showing
specifically four spades only. East concluded with 2S, assured
of the four-four fit. The C5 was led to declarer's queen, and
the king was immediately cashed. The next trick was extremely
odd. Declarer played a spade to the king!, and this was allowed
to hold.

South transferred to hearts after North's strong notrump, and
West intervened with 3C. This ran around to South who balanced
with a card-showing double. If North held a little something
extra in clubs, he would likely have gone for the magic plus
200 at matchpoints. Indeed, that would have been their score
if he had found a pass. His 3D announced a fifth diamond and
only two hearts, so South could pass with some security. With
the foul heart break, they had done well to avoid that strain.
