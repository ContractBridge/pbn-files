{
A splendid auction! A 2-over-1 response with extras, a reverse
by opener followed by club support showing the 1=4=5=3 pattern,
bidding of controls slowly, culminating in a Roman Key-Card ask
to confirm that one key is missing but the queen of clubs is
present.

{
Another good auction with opener "patterning out" to show his
minimum 5=4=1=3 hand. However, the eventual three notrump wasn't
a great contract. West found the most effective lead, the H4.
East topped dummy's HJ with the HK and returned the H3 to West's
HA. West played the H9 to drive out dummy's HQ, and now declarer
needed some luck.

{
East opened an Acolish one heart on a thin four-card suit, and
over South's one-spade overcall West bid two clubs in the classic
Acol "Delayed Game Raise" style. North's weak jump raise drew
a sound four-club raise from East. With the bidding already at
the four-level, West could not complete his plan of jumping to
four hearts; East, expecting only three-card support, "corrected"
four hearts to five clubs; West made a matchpoint error by not
correcting to hearts.

{
After opening a light, shapely one diamond and receiving a two-spade
response from North over West's two-club overcall, South jumped
to four spades. That was an overbid, yet it might have worked
very well if South had the right (club, not heart) singleton.
West, with aces and kings coming out of his ears, expressed his
disbelief by doubling.

West opened a weakish notrump. Doubling a weak notrump with a
one-suiter seldom pays when the weak notrumpers have a decent
runout system; it's usually better to show your suit. South took
his opponents off the hook when he bid a four-card suit before
they found their best spot. North, who had not shown his suit,
had to correct to three clubs.

South wisely kept silent with his balanced hand. East, a weak
notrumper, showed 15 to 17 HCP with her one-notrump rebid; West
raised to two notrump overoptimistically, a game try that East
of course rejected. South's least-of-evils C2 lead let East score
the C9. Quite properly, South let East's HK hold Trick Two.

clubs. North may have been surprised to find his weak jump raise

North opened a light but shapely one heart. In reply to East's
takeout double, West made a weak two-spade jump, a very uncommon
treatment of that bid. With his powerful balanced hand, East
still had visions of game. He rebid two notrump to describe his
values, but subsided after West signed off in three spades.

{
South's initial pass let West show hearts via a Jacoby Transfer.
South's belated two spades in a live auction put him in jeopardy
of a cooperative double; luckily, it was West who was short in
spades, North who had four. West's three clubs took South off
the hook but North's three spades on trash put him back on. When
East failed to double, West bid four clubs. West being unlimited,
East gave false preference to four hearts. With three likely
winners, South doubled.

North's wafer-thin sandwich one spade with a balanced hand escaped
the punishment I think it deserved when East, not South, had
the spade void. East's playing-strength raise to four hearts
inspired South, with a weak distributional hand, to bid four
spades. That too escaped punishment when West used Roman Key-Card
Blackwood to drive to six hearts. East's five-notrump reply,
in the usual RKCB methods, showed two keys and a void, but of
course West didn't care about the spade void.

South's "Multi" two diamonds (usually a weak two-bid type hand
in a major) didn't deter West from bidding two notrump without
a heart stopper; I wonder if an ordinary weak two-heart bid would.
East had the stopper, and enough to raise to three notrump.

some pairs still adhere to the old-fashioned strong-but-not-forcing

surely had the hand to pass East's two hearts.
