{
After a straightforward, natural, standard auction to three notrump,
North led an equally straightforward fourth-best club. Declarer
correctly ducked twice, and after taking the third club perforce
with dummy's CA, led the D9. South ducked correctly, catering
to the chance that West was missing the D10 and intended to let
the D9 ride, but soon declarer was able to knock out South's
diamond stopper and claim an overtrick. Minus 630, a most normal
result.

{
I haven't seen many of those lately (18-point notrumps), except
when I'm bidding them, but I like it, I like it. West took what
might be an "anti-field" action in not choosing to play in spades
(presumably via a transfer) but that too was eminently reasonable,
with a balanced hand and all his strength outside of spades.
Take a tip from me: with hands like West's, transfer to a five-card
heart suit, but pass with five spades.

{
West's decision to treat his hand as worth a game invitation
in response to East's wide-range notrump (compare Boards 17 and
18) risked getting too high, but at least his use of Stayman
landed the pair in the best strain.

The "Polish Club" opening allowed South to go slow with his big
hand, eventually crawling up to the sound notrump game. (He could
show minimum opening high-card strength and long clubs, one of
the other hand types embraced by the Polish Club, by jumping
to three clubs at his second turn.)

West opened a light, shapely hand with good spot-cards in his
suit, and redoubled South's unshapely takeout double to show
three-card support for East's (such as they were) spades. Of
course with a club void and little defense, he could not sit
East's penalty double of two clubs (an unbeatable contract despite
the 6-0 club split).

{
Weak two-bids sometimes come in pairs; if I were South, I would
fear that East's "Multi" two diamonds was based on a weak heart
hand. Daunted by that fear, North's initial pass, and adverse
vulnerability, I wouldn't dare bid two hearts. Presumably, West
doubled two hearts on the assumption that East was weak with
spades; East, with a trick-and-a-half in defense and thin spades,
had no excuse to pull, much less jump to three spades.

{
In response to South's "Multi" two diamonds (usually a weak two-bid
type hand in a major), North could bid two hearts with a good
hand only for spades or two notrump with a good hand for both
majors. That left his three-spade jump available to show fine
spades and a good hand, and South had an easy raise to four spades.
Don't look now, but a wild and crazy "unusual" four notrump by
West could lead to an unbeatable five diamonds. Nah, nobody would
do that!

South started with a rare aceless jump shift and rebid his spades
to show an independent suit. After a couple of control-bids from
North, South used Roman Key-Card Blackwood to learn that two
aces were missing, and signed off in a less than iron-clad five
spades.

How weak can the "weak major" hand on which North's two diamonds
was based be? I couldn't imagine it would be as weak as North's
actual hand, and perhaps South couldn't when he jumped to four
spades with his good hand and solid five-card suit.

Polish, with West responding a natural one spade, East making
a splinter raise, and West, for lack of extra strength or extra
spade length, signing off in four spades.
