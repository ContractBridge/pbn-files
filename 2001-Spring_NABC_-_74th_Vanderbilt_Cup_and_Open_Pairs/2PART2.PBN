{
South, with a soft 12 HCP and three-two in the majors, was not
content to pass the deal out. His stronger-minor one club proved
unlucky when West, short in clubs, made a pushy takeout double
and struck gold.

South suppressed fine club support to bid two notrump at his

who could not know how near his topless clubs were to establishment,
bid a pushy three notrump that had a chance only because of South's
good clubs.

To raise an overcall on high-honor-doubleton is good expert practice,
but Lev overreached when he raised with two low hearts and diamond
strength in front of the one-diamond opener. Points, shmoints:
Pszczola had the right hand to jump to game.

Adverse vulnerability succeeded in keeping East-West out of the

defense - a passive high-spot lead from a topless four spades
- lets North take two spades and ruff a third in dummy.

clubs (rather than, say, five hearts) and two aces, and East
restrainedly sold out to three clubs undoubled.

better to do. South, of course, could not seek slam when North

West's two hearts showed a hand in the weak-two range, but with
five-five in hearts and a undisclosed minor; East's two spades
was corrective. In light of that, South's vulnerable three-club
back-in was not as scary as it seems, but East's double was.
If West had five diamonds, East's top diamonds might not both
be defensive tricks.

West was too weak for his sequence; better to open a slightly
off-shape one notrump (if strong),or bid one diamond then two
clubs, or even one club then two clubs. Having reversed, he could
hardly sell out to two spades; theorist Eric Kokish may have
the right idea, doubling for takeout in the passout seat and
getting out in three of a minor.

Some might bid a Michaels two spades with West's hand, others
play that this would show a weaker, or much stronger, two-suiter.
Note, however, that Michaels would get the partnership to the
three level: dangerous facing a possible weak misfitting hand,
especially when vulnerable.

{
Lev reached two hearts on a straightforward auction likely to
be duplicated at any table. The choice between plausible D3 and
C7 leads may seem a tossup, but East's D3 was right for two subtle
reasons. (1) The lower the spot, the easier for partner to read
it correctly; a high spot might be from shortness, greater length,
or a topless four-card suit. (2) Most pairs play Drury, so a
passed-hand one-notrump response is more likely to conceal clubs
than diamonds.

West played three notrump after denying a four-card major on
a Stayman auction. The play may have seemed as simple as the
bidding. On North's H10 lead. West tried dummy's HQ, and ducked
twice when South played the HK then the HJ. A third heart dislodged
the HA; West attacked diamonds, and relieved to find the DA with
the short hearts, soon claimed nine tricks: plus 400; 24 MP's.
