{
Our featured pair for this first session, Mike Passell and Eddie
Wold, are both in the Top 10 on the ACBL all-time masterpoint
winners list. Both have also represented the USA in the Bermuda
Bowl, Passell winning that trophy in 1979. They were pushed to
the 3-level on this first deal, and Passell missed a tough chance
for a huge matchpoint score as 3H-doubled can be beaten two tricks
for plus 300 (South must lead a club at Trick 1 or after cashing
one high spade).

{
Highly competitive E/W bidding forced Passell to guess, and he
guessed to bid what turned out to be a 2-ace slam. Wold kicked
off with a normal enough strong notrump and after West's 2H overcall
Passell jumped to 4H (presumably showing a 4S bid). When Jo Ginsberg
upped the ante to 5H, holding only one 1st-round control Wold
might have doubled to show an unsuitable hand if the partnership
methods considered the pass forcing.

{
Passell put the cat amongst the pigeons with his third-seat pre-empt,
which looks like a fairly normal action, and East's takeout double
when either a simple 3H overcall or a shot at 3NT would have
worked better. Indeed, 3NT is unbeatable - declarer must score
four hearts, two diamonds and three clubs, while the defense
can get at most two spades and a trick in each red suit.

{
N/S attempted their second hopeless slam in four boards. This
time, though, with two natural trump tricks, it was virtually
impossible for the defenders to let it through. Responsibility
for this debacle lies primarily although not entirely with Passell
(MS). His decision to open 2C would not meet with universal approval
(or mine). And although it seems clear that 5C was a cue-bid,
Passell's decision to raise the suit is a strange action.

{
The first three bids were normal, but West seems to have been
scared off by the adverse vulnerablity. Had he made a preemptive
jump to 3S at his first turn, he would quite likely have bought
the contract. No one has a double of 3S, which will quietly drift
one down for E/W minus 100 and an above average matchpoint score
for the Hammans. Over his actual 2S bid, North could show long
clubs and, when West went to 3S anyway, Wold competed to 4C.

{
West rolled the dice and came up smelling of roses. Beginners
are taught not to use Stayman on this hand type because you are
stuck over a 2D response unless you are able to then bid 2H to
give opener a choice of majors, weak. Bob showed why he is such
a great player - he holds the right hand to justify his partner's
bidding. Wold was unlikely to find the best lead - king and another
heart, although his actual choice of a trump need not have conceded
a trick as Passell could have ducked once Hamman had not put
up dummy's ten.

Wold opened the South hand with 2D, a conventional opening popular
showing both majors, 2-10 HCP. Passell jumped to 4H, which might
have been a preemptive move but this time he bid it expecting
to have play.

{
This is a tough hand for N/S, but after seeing how aggressive
they are in the slam zone one would have expected them to breeze
into one that is well within the odds. 6H is about 65% as it
needs little more than trumps 3-3 or 4-2 with either the queen
or the ten doubleton, while 6D and even 7D are both fair spots.
Bidding any of the decent slams is not easy, though. Indeed,
Passell did not even mention either of his suits, conducting
instead a quantitative aucion to 4NT.

{
Sid Brownstein must have had high hopes when he picked up this
East hand. For sure, he did not expect that the opponents would
be cold for a slam, but they are. The theory of consecutive slams
might have encouraged N/S to bid this one.  Barring a second-round
club ruff, only clubs 4-2 and diamonds 3-0 will beat this one.
 They are, but it is the defender with short clubs who must hold
the trumps for the contract to fail.

{
Imagine the conflicting emotions of West and North as trumps
changed from spades to hearts. West was clearly mesmerized by
the possibility of defending a spade contract - he has to bid
clubs at some point, either with a 2C overcall at his first turn
(a la Lawrence) or over 2H. Expecting East to back in when 2H
is passed around to him is just too much. E/W have 10 easy tricks
in clubs.

{
N/S reached a game that had no chance, although it is easy to
see why Passell accepted the game try, with a near maximum, K-10
in Wold's game-try suit and no wasted values in East's club suit.
Indeed, it seems that he was trying to show a super-maximum and
a slam suitable hand with 4C, just in case his partner had aspirations
beyond game. Perhaps South's game try is just a bit much on this
hand? Wold made a good play at Trick 1 when he ducked what he
knew was a singleton CK lead, hoping for a diamond switch.
