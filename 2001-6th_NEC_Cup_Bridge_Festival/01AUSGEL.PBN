{
Over North's classic weak 2S both Ogihara and Schiesser bit the
bullet and tried 2NT, surely not liking it much. Geller checked
for a heart fit but Wernle, fearing spade ruffs, sensibly raised
to 3NT. In effect, the textbook weak two pushed the E/W pairs
into a game they would not have bid on their own. A spade lead
and diamond shift could have led to a quick three down but it
didn't happen that way at either table.

{
Geller took a conservative approach by inviting game and focusing
on hearts. With a good hand for that strain Ogihara saw no need
to continue describing her own hand. Gloyer stayed off the unbid
suit, leading the S4, Geller ducking to the king. Schifko switched
to a diamond to secure the ace and on the diamond return, Geller
went up with the king, discarding a club. Then SK to throw a
club, D ruff, CA, C ruff, D ruff, C ruff, D ruff, Shifko discarding
spade, club, spade. In the three-card ending Geller was poised
to make his contract by exiting with the 7. Gloyer went in with
the eight but Shifko overtook with the nine to return the four.
Geller went up with the ace but the king did not drop, so he
was one down: minus 50. What a curious position, If South had
indeed started with three small hearts (as Geller assumed) he
could not afford to ruff in, keeping a spade to lead for the
trump promotion late in the day, because Geller would eventually
be able to play ace and another trump to clear the suit. So with
three small trumps Shifko would have been squeezed out of the
spade he needed to save Gloyer's doubleton king of trumps.

{
It's not clear to me why Schifko didn't show his hearts directly
and one of the effects of his bidding was that he had to guess
which game would be better without having all the information
he needed [EK]. Perhaps it would have been better to show a good
six-card heart suit and allow partner to choose the strain. Gloyer
got a diamond lead and with the CK right and hearts three-two,
took all the tricks: plus 520. Well, maybe the straightforward
auction wasn't good enough, because in that context Abe chose
notrump when hearts would have been safer. Thirteen tricks on
a diamond lead: plus 520. No swing. Still 0-0.

{
5-card trump support and a singleton opposite a vulnerable 2-level
overcall might have tempted many players to take up some bidding
room, but Shifko settled for a gentle raise, and Geller was permitted
to declare 4H in relative peace. He got the lead of the C4 and
established a long spade for his 12th trick; plus 680. East's
decision to compete with a negative double rather than a direct
2H is in itself a close one. Morozumi showed much more initiative
by bouncing all the way to 5D, setting a problem for E/W. As
it happens the only losing action is to pass out 5D, which can
be set 3. If East's 2-level negative double establishes a forcing
pass situation at the 5-level, West is under no pressure to act
with a marginal hand that could take plenty of tricks on offense.
If pass is not forcing, whatever West decides to do is very uncomfortable.
Here, where Wernle did not double, Schiesser judged it expedient
to try 5H and he found a suitable dummy. On a diamond lead Schiesser
could have taken 12 tricks by starting spades but he drew trumps
first and could no longer establish the long spade: plus 650.
1 IMP to Geller, for the first swing in the match.

{
Ogihara's heavy Flannery 2D opening worked beautifully when Geller
settled for a gentle 2H and shut everyone out; N/S could make
4C. Even 2H was too high, however, when Gloyer cashed two clubs
and switched to a trump. The defenders stayed off spades and
Geller lost two of those and two diamonds to go one down: minus
50. Wernle, facing a limited opening bid, tried to muddy the
waters by starting with a semi-forcing notrump (5-11). I've never
understood why the fact that opener can't have 17 points makes
a raise to 2NT with 16 a good bid, but someone is sure to tell
to me sooner or later. Here Schiesser's raise got him to 3H,
which looks like the reasonable resting place for E/W.  Morozumi
led a spade to the nine and ten and now the defenders had to
cash out to defeat 3Hx but Morozumi duly switched to a club when
he won the King and the rest was easy. One down: minus 50. No
swing. Still Geller, 1-0.

{
Apparently the value of the spade suit is not something at which
to sneeze in Austria, or we'd be hard pressed to justify an overcall
of 1S with that North hand. Apparently Shifko has seen some of
Gloyer's best efforts in this area for he contented himself with
a simple raise over Ogihara's passed-hand free bid of 2H. Later,
however, Shifko changed his mind and saved unilaterally at 4S,
sparing Ogihara some potential anxiety in 4H. Diamonds were not
played until late, and by then Gloyer had an idea where the ace
was located, so he got out for down three: minus 500. If Schiesser
could bring home 4H Schifko's undisciplined action would bring
in a few points, if not, Austria was booked for a heavy loss.
The odds were simply awful, which might give you some idea about
the quality of the double-clutch 4S. The "impossible" diamond
lead, he would have defeated 4H, but a spade was led. Schiesser
knocked out the CA and the HK, discarded a D on a high C, ruff
his last S in dummy, and with the DA still in hand, drew the
last trump safely for plus 620. A D at trick 2, might still have
defeated 4H. 3 hair-raising IMPs to Austria.

{
Apparently vulnerability is not a big issue when a would-be Austrian
overcaller holds five spades and here Shifko provides us with
a glimpse of the tolerance level for such an endeavour. The rest
of the auction might have been no fun at all for him but Geller
took him off the hook by volunteering 1NT, converted to (just)
2H by Ogihara. Schifko's decision to lead the S10 was not a big
success for it convinced Ogihara to play ace king of trumps,
among things. Plus 140. Left to themselves, Schiesser/Wernle
drove themselves to 3NT, an ugly little contract that seems doomed
on the lie of the cards. Appearances can be deceiving, of course.
Abe decided to lead a low D and the nine won. Wernle led a H
to the J and Q and Morozumi switched to a low spade to the J
and Q. Wernle cashed the A-K of hearts, getting the bad news,
and ran the C9 to the king. Abe did not cash the high H but instead
exited with the C6. Morozumi did not cover dummy's ten so now
Wernle could lead a spade towards the K for plus 600. A 10-IMP
gain for Austria, 13-1.

{
This deal will not make the highlight reel for two-tier (weak
or strong) two-suited overcalls. Gloyer was left to declare 1S
on a five-zero fit when he could have made 6H on a five-four
fit. My heart goes out to him, for it could have happened to
me, I suppose, although I would like to believe that South would
not pass 1S. Gloyer took eight tricks when Ogihara led her singleton
heart and later Geller gave her a ruff, shortening her trumps
while establishing declarer's side suit. Plus 110. Abe's less
constrained Michaels Cue-bid would have located the heart fit
immediately, but apparently there was some doubt in everyone's
mind about the nature of 2D against a 2+ (cards) 1D  opening.
Schiesser, who was told that 2D was Michaels, stuck in a 2H cue-bid
to show a decent diamond raise that he didn't have. Morozumi
thought 2D was natural and so informed Wernle, who duly raised
Schiesser's "natural" 2H. It's not clear why Schiesser then interpreted
3H as natural and passed before worse befell him, but in doing
so he hit a home run, He took a remarkable four tricks: two spades
(yes), a club, and a trump: minus 250. 4 IMPs to Geller; 5-13.

{
A late alert in the Open Room (about the 1S response) resulted
in the auction being adjusted to the one you see here. 3H was
deemed to go just one down, perhaps on the basis of the remarkable
defense at the other table as a guideline.  Remarkably, no one
has protested this decision. N/S minus 50. Wernle's 3NT suggests
that he likes to roll the dice and it would appear that this
does not have a negative effect on his teammates' morale. Whether
it affected Schiesser's defense on this deal, however, is another
question. Against 4H doubled, Schiesser cashed a high spade,
then switched to a club. Abe won the king and played two more
rounds of clubs, discarding the SQ as Wernle ruffed in with the
HQ. Ace and another diamond followed and Schiesser erred by ruffing
low in front of dummy. Now Abe could overruff and play a trump,
crashing the defensive honors. Ouch. Losing his concentration,
Schiesser played a club, and now declarer could ruff in dummy
and discard his last spade. Just one down: minus 100. 2 IMPs
to Austria, ahead 15-5.

{
Perhaps 2H is automatic but I don't think so, although both Norths
were willing to risk it. Ogihara followed the Law of Total Tricks
and bounced to 4H, forcing a decision on Schifko. His double
looks like the practical action, particularly facing a somewat
random overcall. There were five obvious losers so Geller was
two down: minus 500. Schiesser contented himself with 3S, then
sold out to 4H, refusing to break discipline. There was nothing
to the play after two rounds of spades, but had Wernle switched
to a club, Schiesser would have been in a position to defeat
the contract by ducking, leaving the communications open for
West to get a club ruff. Plus 620 for Abe-san and 3 IMPs to Geller,
8-15. Most E/W pairs competed to 4Sx but we can report that England's
Glyn Liggins/Joe Fawcett sold out to 4Hx and defeated it.

{
The West hand is not a classic weak two-bid, but it's not exactly
a lovely one-bid either. Geller tried 2S and the final cotract
was never in doubt. Gloyer started with the D4, second from a
weak holding and Schifko ducked dummy's king. The SK lost to
the ace and a low club went to the jack and queen. Gloyer reverted
to diamonds, leading the deuce, and the ten lost to the jack.
When Schifko tried to cash the DA, Geller misguessed, ruffing
high. He played two high trumps and conceded one down: minus
50. That looked very good indeed for Austria. But no. After 1S
Schiesser began to think of slam. Wernle followed up with 2 cue-bids,
it was impossible to turn Schiesser off below the 5-level. The
D3 went to the K and A and Morozumi switched to the H7. Wernle
put up the K and finessed the D10, hoping to discard the singleton
H. The DJ won and Morozumi continued spades. Wernle won in dummy
and knocked out the HA. Morozumi won and returned his last trump.
Wernle exited with the CJ and if the play record is to be credited,
Abe won and played ... a H. Just two down: minus 100. 2 IMPs
to Geller, 10-15.

{
The Austrians came to rest in their most promising strain, albeit
a level or two higher than they might have preferred. Ogihara
found the excellent diamond lead, queen, king, ace, and Gloyer
finessed the HQ, threw a diamond on the HA, and lost the SK to
the ace. Gloyer ruffed the third diamond and tried the S10, losing
to the queen. When Ogihara exited safely with the thirteenth
diamond Geller ruffed with the master trump, so Gloyer discarded
a club: plus 140. Schiesser's third-seat 1S suggests that his
inclination to psych might not be as rare as his convention card
suggests. He survived well enough when Wernle allowed Morizumi
to play peacefully in 1NT. On the lead of the HJ to the king
and ace Morizumi was in fair shape. He led the SK to the ace
and Wernle switched to the DK and it got easier for Morizumi
after that; he ducked a club and finished with seven tricks:
plus 90. 2 IMPs to Austria, 17-10.

Schifko's hand doesn't fit the description of his sequence (1NT
was 12-14) but who's counting. 3D produced plenty of tricks -
ten of them to be exact: plus 130. In the Closed Room, where
Morozumi couldn't tell that Abe held abalanced hand, it was awkward
for him to compete over 2H. Just as well. He led his club against
2H and Schiesser won in dummy to duck a trump to the ten. Morozumi
switched to a spade and after three rounds of thise switched
to the D7. Schiesser won, ducked a heart to the king, ruffed
the thirteenth spade, and exited hopefully with a heart. Abe
took two heart tricks, and dummy was squeezed. Abe tucked dummy
in with a club and the defense got two diamonds later. Four down:
minus 400. 7 IMPs to Geller, tying the match at 17.

As Geller has demonstrated his willingness to rebid 1NT in this
situation with a singleton heart Ogiwars was reluctant to branch
out into her long suit. 1NT did not handle well, Schifko ducking
hearts twice and Gloyer ducking clubs not at all. Two down: minus
100. Schiesser's 2H showed at least five hearts and an unknown
second suit. Apparently it could have been truly repulsive nonvulnerable
for Wernle never peeped , holding the best hand at the table,
with a fit. Against Morozumi's 3D Wernle led the H10. Morozumi
won and played a spade and now Wernle couldn't do everything
at once. He switched to a club but Morozumi won and played loser-on-loser
with the SQ, eventually coming to ten tricks: plus 130. 1 IMP
to Geller, 18-17.

The defense got busy against Geller's 2S after the CJ to the
king and ace. Diamond to the queen and ace, diamond nine to the
king, jack, SQ. Plus 170. Wernle's raise to 2NT, unlike Schiesser's
on Board 7, makes a lot of sense, especially if it shows this
type of hand, a 3S bid with a decent suit, suitable for notrump.
Morozumi led a low club to the nine and . . . four. The CJ went
to the queen and and ace and a third club left Schiesser with
two club winners. He had nine tricks now: plus 150. 1 IMP more
