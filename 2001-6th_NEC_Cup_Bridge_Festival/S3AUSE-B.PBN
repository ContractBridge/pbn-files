{
OR - There were 16 boards left in the second NEC semifinal match
between e-bridge and  Australia/Argentina. e-bridge held a useful
lead - 99 to 65 IMPs. The Australians play a "major-based" relay
system called "Moscito", and Paul Marston began proceedings with
the their strong opening. Ishmael Del'Monte's 1S response showed
9+ HCP, four or more hearts, and less than four spades. Lev jumped
to 3S, but North used RKCB in hearts to land in slam. The D9
provided the twelfth trick: plus 980 for N/S. [Match Host: Drew

{
CR - The Poles play "Polish Club", of course, and Jacek Pszczola
began with the two-way club (either strong, or a balanced weak
notrump). Piotr Gawrys' 1H response was 8+ HCP, and at least
four hearts. Pablo Lambardi tried the same obstructive effort
as Lev in the Open Room, and North doubled to show the strong
opener. South, lacking any black-suit controls, plumped for 4H.
Again, the D9 proved it's worth, and declarer had twelve tricks:
plus 480 for N/S. 11 IMPs to Aus/Arg, and e-bridge's lead was
quickly cut to 23 IMPs.

{
OR - After John Mohan's 1S opener, Lev used a "Bergen Raise"
to 3D to show a four-card limit raise. Mohan looked no further
than the spade game, and Del'Monte led the H2 (lowest from odd),
which went to the nine, three, and jack. Declarer had to locate
one of the two missing "pointed" queens to secure his contract,
and began this detective work by playing on clubs. An unsuccessful
guess in spades was followed by a successful one in diamonds:
ten tricks, and plus 420 for E/W.

{
CR - Lambardi had a similar tool available to him after Pablo
Ravenna's 1S opening. The 2NT response was a four-card limit
raise or better, and East's 3C bid denied any shortness. 3S showed
the limit raise, and Ravenna concluded the auction with 4S. Gawrys
led the H8 (the Poles lead second and fourth best with attitude
connotations), and declarer won the jack. A spade to the king
solved declarer's problems, and he eventually emerged with ten
tricks, losing two clubs and one diamond: plus 420 for E/W, and
no swing. e-bridge leading 99 to 76 IMPs.

OR - Del'Monte began with the strong Moscito opening of 1C (15+
HCP), and Marston's 1D response denoted zero to eight and a half
HCP. South's 1NT was 15-18 HCP balanced, and the four-four major-suit
fits went begging. The defense took their five diamond tricks
on the go, and declarer had seven tricks (one spade, three hearts,
and three clubs): plus 90 for N/S.

{
CR - Gawrys opened a 14+ to 17 HCP notrump, and Pszczola chose
to move with the North hand. If he hit a four-card major, he
would be perfectly happy to play there, and if partner bid 2D,
he was equally prepared to play in a four-three major-suit fit
(2H would allow partner a choice of majors). The layout could
not have been more friendly, and declarer easily took ten tricks:
plus 170 for N/S. A 2 IMP gain for e-bridge, and their lead was
now 25 IMPs. Current score: e-bridge 101  -  Australia/Argentina

[Declarer "E"]
{
OR - A rather good slam in both red suits. As it happens, 6D
is cold, but 6H would suffer the indignity of being doubled for
a diamond lead, and go down one. Unless, E/W could arrange to
play 6H from the West seat. Though, if North did double, would
he get a diamond or a spade lead? The latter seems more likely,
unless East shows both his suits. The N/S interference was timely
enough to inhibit a meaningful exchange of information for E/W.
Marston took the level from Mohan, and Del'Monte took the cue-bid
from Lev. CK, club meant plus 680 for N/S.

{
CR - Here, the Argentine pair had a free run, but nevertheless
alighted in the same contract as the Open Room. Lambardi had
a difficult rebid after Ravenna's forcing-notrump. The choice
really fell between 2D and 2NT. The CQ may or may not be a good
notrump card, but West gave the card it's due, and bid 2NT. When
East advanced with 3H, West simply raised to 4H, instead of cue-bidding
4C. A pessimistic pass by East resulted in the missed slam. Or
did it? Not with Gawrys on lead! Plus 620 for E/W. 2 IMPs to
e-bridge.

{
OR - Marston's 2C opening showed 9-13 HCP with six or more clubs,
and possibly a four-card major. The auction followed a natural
course to 4H, and Mohan made a convertible values double. Declarer
would make 4H if he plays West for the H-J10, after the defense
cashes two diamonds followed by a spade shift. The C8 is the
key. Smartly, Lev removed to 4S (which fails by one trick only),
and just as smartly, Del'Monte removed to 5C. Declarer could
handle the four-one heart break when the clubs broke two-two:
eleven tricks, and plus 600 for N/S.

CR - Pszczola's 2C opening announced 10-14 HCP, with six or more
clubs, and possibly a four-card major. Gawrys had to double 2S
with his collection, as a free-bid wouldn't have been forcing.
Lambardi took the three-level away, and the heart suit was forever
buried, when Ravenna bid 4S. Perhaps, that was just as well.
E/W would likely defeat 4H, as Pszczola would hardly divine the
heart position. Gawrys carried on with 5C, and eleven tricks
were taken on an identical sequence of plays: plus 600 for N/S,
and no swing. e-bridge leads: 103 to 76 IMPs.

{
OR - E/W were never in any danger of getting too high as the
1NT rebid showed 12-14 HCP. Lev settled for a 2S contract because
of his internal spade spots and small doubleton club. Indeed,
the spade spots proved useful in negating South's four spades.
After the H10 lead, the defense were only able to take two spades
and two clubs for nine tricks to E/W. A useful plus 140 for E/W.

{
CR - Ravenna's 14-16 HCP notrump presented Lambardi with a different
problem. Normally, the sequence would go: 1NT-2H-2S-2NT-Pass
- making two. Here, Lambardi knew he was down in the match, his
spade spots may prove useful, and his side was vulnerable. All
these signs pointed to 3NT, and Lambardi duly bid it. Unfortunately,
West had shown his spade suit, and South wasn't going to lead
a low spade, which allows the contract to make when declarer
wins the king. Gawrys led a club: minus 100 for E/W. 6 IMPs to
e-bridge, ahead 109-76.

to do. As you can see from the layout, the only winning shift

notrump hand let the Aussies assay game, and the Poles rest at
the one-level. The swing could have gone either way, with 16
IMPs on the line. Declarer took nine tricks on an eventual spade
shift by West: plus 150 for N/S. It might have been 6 IMPs to

of clubs. So, a 5D save would cost 500. The HQ lead was taken

{
CR - Pszczola opened the two-way club (strong, or a weak notrump),
and Gawrys's 1S response showed eight-plus HCP, and four or more
spades. The 1NT rebid was 11+ to 14- HCP and denied four spades.
Again, as we have seen on some previous boards, the notrump delineations
created slight differences in actions. With the "plus" on his
side, Gawrys jumped to 3NT. The H2 lead went to the queen, and
ace. Here, Ravenna saw the five tricks for the defense, and simply
held onto them (he blocked the hearts). Down one: minus 100 for
N/S, and 6 IMPs to Aus/Arg. Within 17.

controls), and Mohan went through Stayman before inviting the
notrump game. Lev had little problem passing that, but would
encounter great difficulties making it. Marston found the excellent
lead of the C4, which went to the queen and king. The CA was
removed from dummy, and the defense carefully avoided any endplays,
emerging with eight tricks: down three, and minus 300 for E/W.

the process insinuated something extra with his 2H bid. Ravenna
would have made a further move towards game if his hand had contained
a fifth heart. When the "Moysian" fit was known, East settled
for the partscore. Argentina had scored a goal. Declarer had
eight tricks, losing two diamonds, and one trick in each of the
other suits. Plus 110 for E/W, and 9 IMPs to Australia/Argentina,

was that 1C was either a weak notrump, or 16+ HCP unbalanced,
or 18+ HCP balanced. Here, declarer attacked the spade suit at
his first opportunity, whereas South in the Open Room went to
the HK, and played on clubs. This resulted in one extra trick
on offense in this room, and declarer arrived at a seventh trick
for down two only. Minus 100 for N/S, and 2 IMPs to e-bridge,

OR - Marston's 1NT showed 11-14 HCP, and denied a five-card major.
A series of relays uncovered the 3-3-4-3 distribution, and RKCB
in clubs revealed the two missing keycards, allowing the partnership
to stop in 5C. Unfortunately, because South was on a quest to
find the perfect-fit cards for the club slam, the makeable 4NT
contract was by-passed. Relay systems have one failing - sometimes,
specific high-cards are located at too high a level. Declarer
was quickly down two on the SJ lead, when East obtained the heart
ruff: minus 200 for N/S.

bid a forcing 3C. Lambardi made a fit-showing leap to 4H to show
his major two-suiter within the context of the auction (ie. the
opponents were in a forcing auction). Pszczola slowed the auction
down with his two doubles - the first double showed 11+ to 14-
HCP in a balanced hand, and the second was no interest in the
five-level. Two down: minus 300 for E/W. A good save vs the making
notrump game, but here an 11 IMPs loss, instead of a gain of
8 IMPs. e-bridge: 122-100 now.

neither Mohan nor Lev could bid in this auction. The HQ was led

hand. His 2H transfer after Gawrys's 14+ to 17 notrump attracted
an aggressive lead-directing double from Ravenna. Lambardi went
to 4H after Gawrys's super-accept 3S jump, and carried on with

OR - Lev's 2H created a game-force, and when Mohan showed a three-card
diamond suit after bidding his black suits naturally, 6NT seemed
the logical landing pad. Marston led the S3, and it went to the
jack, and ace. After ace, king, and a diamond to North's queen,
one hurdle had been crossed, but the hand was far from over.
Declarer won north's spade exit with the king, and crossed to
hand to play the thirteenth diamond, creating a progressive squeeze
against South. Del'monte hoped North held the S10, and pitched
his SQ, prolonging the inevitable. Plus 990 for E/W.

CR - This board sealed the match for e-bridge. After a similar
start to the auction, Lambardi bid what he thought was a quantitative
4NT, but was unfortunately interpreted as RKCB in diamonds. Ravenna
showed, he thought, two keycards without the DQ. Lambardi may
have bid 6NT now, but the partnership had an expert disaster
when he continued with 5NT. Ravenna, still thinking this was
an RKCB auction, interpreted 5NT as a grand-slam-try. His black
kings convinced him to try 7D. 7NT was two down: minus 100 for
E/W, and 14 huge IMPs to e-bridge, ahead 136-109 now.

suit never got a hearing. Because of the nature of the 1D bid,
Lev kept quiet with his major suits. Though, E/W probably would
take nine tricks in spades. This turned out for the better, when
the defense were able to attack trumps by leading first the ten,
then the queen to promote West's holding. Two down: minus 200

R - South's 14+ to 17 notrump ended the auction when West's lack
of intermediates, and four-five distribution, rather than five-five,
prompted him to take the cautious route. The H4 lead was unfortunate,
in that it allowed declarer to win the jack, and run the CJ successfully.
Other leads allow the defense to prevail in the race for the
seventh trick. Declarer ran his seven tricks for plus 90 for
N/S, and 7 IMPs to e-bridge. With only one board remaining, e-bridge
had an insurmountable lead: 143 to 109 IMPs. The match was closer

OR - Del'Monte took a very practical shot on the last board of
the match. One must assume the suit will run when making these
sorts of bids. Lev had to find a club, or a heart lead to defeat
the game. The H5 lead probably gave South a brief moment of ecstasy
- until the king was topped by the ace anyway. His excellent
gambit went for naught. The defense quickly grabbed their four
hearts, and one spade for one down: minus 50 for N/S.

CR - Ravenna made a negative double with the East hand, keeping
all strains in perspective. Partner could hold as few as three
clubs, and East would be perfectly content passing 1NT on his
flat hand. Gawrys was fairly secure that if he bid 2D, the auction
wasn't going to end after all four players had taken action -
wrong. The H8 was led to the king, and ace. Declarer took his
nine tricks when the defense found the trump shift: plus 110
