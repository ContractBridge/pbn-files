PBN: un-hide the North hand to reveal the dummy.}

How do you like your prospects?
Plan the play.}
{
You note that the other table might be failing in
3NT with a \H lead. Your pd may have taken the best
view holding the \HAx.  Making 5\D could well win
the board and the match.  The \H lead is ugly.  Any
other lead would allow you to draw trumps and
establish a \C for a \H pitch from dummy.  Making
5\D is going to be uphill work with the possibility
of losing 1\S 1\H and 1\C. You consider ducking the
\HA or trying for some elimination position which
could eliminate a \S loser.}

Is there _any_ way to make 5\D now?}

LHO rates from the auction to hold all or almost
all the outstanding HCP.  RHO holds JT43 of \D.
You'll need 2 dummy entries for the \D finesses and
2 are available in the \SK and \CJ.  Do you want to
spend all of your precious dummy entries for
finessing \D?}

Life would be easier if LHO had flown with the \CA.
Then 2 \S losers could be discarded from dummy on
your KQ of \C.}

small \C toward the J.}

How do you rate your chances of holding your
losers to 2?  What now?

It seems that RHO may have made a mistake in
covering the 3rd rd of \D from dummy with the J.
You now have an additional trump entry to dummy
with the \D8.  Can you make him pay for it?

A glimmer of hope starts forming in your mind.
Maybe, just maybe, you can bring this contract home
on a squeeze or endplay of some sort onyour LHO.
What would you need to endplay or squeeze your LHO?
You consider exiting a \H at this point which might
work out if LHO wins and then has to lead a \S or
\C.  A problem arises if RHO wins the \H and exits
a \S.  So that plan seems out.  Maybe you can
squeeze LHO in the black suits if he was dealt
something like:
    QJx(x)
    KQJxx(x)
    void
    ATxx
Either 4-5-0-4 or 3-6-0-4 with LHO might work.
Looking at the threat situation, you see that you
might have 2 threats against LHO with the \ST in
dummy and the fourth \C in hand. First, though, the
count needs to be rectified for any sort of squeeze
to work.  Is this the time to rectify the count or
do you want to draw the last trump?

Well, it looks like a positional squeeze on LHO is
out because dummy holds the long \D and you'll have
to discard in front of LHO.  After all of your hard
work, it still looks like you're going to need some
help from your opponents.  Perhaps a little
flim-flam pseudo-squeeze will bring this contract
home.  But first a bit of deception can be tried.}
CA
{Alas, LHO wins this trick, and }
   C3 C6 CQ
{
So you try the \CQ.  You hope that LHO ducks this
as then you could ruff both losing \Cs with dummy's
remaining trumps and only lose a \H and a \S.}
HQ
{cashes his \HQ.}
    H6 H7 H4
{
You hold your breath.  A \S honor return will take
out your entry to hand and spoil your plans.  You
hope your LHO isn't good enough to see this.}
CT S3 C7 CK
{LHO exits with the \CT which you take with the K
in hand.  Pitching a small \S from dummy.}
C9
{
Whew!
You needed to work hard on this hand and still
needed some luck and some help from the opponents.
Congratulate yourself for a job well done!

Moral: Don't give up, even when things looks
       impossible. Give your opponents enough
       chances to make mistakes and sometimes they
       will.}

When you lead the \D7 from hand, LHO holding:

has a legitimate problem. Up to this point, the \HT
and \C8 remain outstanding and LHO may not be able
to tell which card you hold.  A better opponent
would have a count on the hand and will discard
correctly.  After long study, LHO pitches his ...}
