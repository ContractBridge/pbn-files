East's hand is a mandatory strong club because of the 10 RP.  West
responds with a non-game-forcing positive response (5+ RP, 9+ LP) 
in spades.  East shows a minimum misfit, giving partner a chance to
get out low if necessary; West has extras and continues the relay
chain, showing diamonds (2H), then 6241 shape (3N), then 7 RP (4S).
East quits and plays 4S.

The play is interesting.  With everything breaking declarer should
lose only two spades and a diamond, yes?  Well...

HK lead to the ace; GIB crosses to the SA and cashes CK, then
crosses to the DA and cashes two more clubs, throwing a heart and
a diamond.  Now a diamond from dummy... and GIB *finesses*.  DQ
wins, diamond ruff, club ruff, and South still has a high trump
for down one, -50.

I think GIB's play was right.  If trumps are 4-1 you need to hook
the diamond to make, and even if they're 3-2, the finesse is 50%
to make an overtrick, and only costs the contract if North has 
all three missing diamonds and South has the last club.

WBridge5 had a standard auction to 2H.  This should be held to 2,
but GIB attempted to cash two top diamonds and let declarer pitch
the SJ on the DQ.  Perhaps West couldn't read partner's D6 as the
start of an echo (upside-down count and attitude); I suspect a bug
in the signalling code is responsible for East not playing the D9.
-140.

1H was 8-15, 4+ H, 0-3 S.  Over the takeout double, North was just
shy of a 1NT response; and vulnerable at IMPs opposite a silent
partner between bidding opponents, South has a tough decision 
whether or not to venture 2H.  At the table, GIB passed and let
them play 1NT.  On the HQ lead, declarer sensibly cashed out his
five tricks for down two.  +100.

2 IMPs to WBridge5, leading 12-0.

5431 hands with neither major are the single most awkward shape
for an opening hand in Moscito Byte.  Personally, I'd treat the
West hand as 1444 and open 1H; you might get into a 3-3 partscore,
but you might also steal the opponents suit, or avert a disasterous
diamond lead against their spade contract, or stay out of 2D-X vul
down 1100.

Alas, Matt would go ballistic if I programmed GIB to open 3-card
majors, so 2D it is.  Partner responds a nonforcing (but encouraging)
2S and raises 2NT to 3NT.

What should declarer play from dummy on the H3 lead?  GIB chooses
the H8, covered by the H9, after which the contract is beatable.
But when North chooses to rise with the SA on the first round and
cash the HA, GIB can soon claim 4, +630.

Was WBridge5 confused over whether 3S was forcing, or was it simply

2S and 3S both look like substantial overbids, but when GIB led
a heart to the ace and returned a heart, allowing a club pitch 
from dummy, the contract was makeable.  However, WBridge5 mistimed
the play.  With only one entry to hand remaining, it needed to 
lead a diamond immediately; instead, it drew trumps, played a 
diamond to the ten, and exited in clubs.  GIB cashed its clubs
and forced dummy to ruff a club, after which WBridge5 had to lead
away from the DK, for down one.  -100.

I cannot describe how happy I am that we had an interesting play
problem later in the set, because only that kept this deal from
showing up in the Daily Bulletin.

Two factors contributed to getting to 6C off two aces.  First, there
was a database bug; the system response to 3D should have been 3H, not
3N, leaving more room for exploration.  (With that bug fixed, GIB gets
to 5C, which isn't great but does make.)  Second, KQ doubleton is a
relatively uncommon holding, and relayer's Borel samples contained
many more hands where partner's 7RP 2254 was arranged more usefully.

So, GIB was already doomed to lose 13 IMPs; but when West doubled,
something comic happened.  GIB has a rule saying that after partner's
relay response, the first step is a relay unless it's a bid above 5NT.
But no such rule applies to *passing* a bid above 5NT.  So North's
pass of the double was interpreted as a relay, and South helpfully
showed the HQ and denied the DJ.  West doubled again, North passed
(another relay), and South redoubled, denying the CJ.  North signed
off in 7C, ending relays, West doubled, and that was that.

Everybody laughed.  I hid in a corner.  (And pulled out my laptop,
and started fixing code.)  GIB managed to go down three, for -800.

A well-deserved 16-IMP loss for GIB, and a bemused 16-IMP gain for
WBridge5, now ahead 28-10.

Curious choice of 2C by WBridge5 as South at favorable vulnerability;
a 4C preempt would make life difficult for E-W.  West has a dubious
raise opposite a possible 9-count with four hearts; East probably
reopens with a double (which West removes to 4H), but it's tough.

The unilateral sacrifice in 5C was fairly cheap.  It takes a diamond
lead to put declarer down 3, keeping him from ruffing out the SK for a
diamond pitch.  On the actual heart lead, East took the HA and played
back the DK, hoping for T9 opposite; cost nothing, but made life easy
for declarer.  +300 for GIB.

The West hand is too good for a nonvulnerable weak two bid in Moscito
Byte.  After the 1H opening, North made a dubious 2D overcall, and
South went nuts and jumped to 5D.  5D has chances on some layouts, but
not very good ones after the opening bid; on the actual layout, down
one was certain.  -50 for WBridge5.

2S is a slight overbid (it promises 9-12 LP), but my guess is that GIB
really liked the suit and hated the alternative (passing with that stiff
heart, vulnerable).  This should be down two on the club ruff, but 
despite multiple opportunities, East never gave partner the ruff; 
GIB ended up only down one, for -100 and 5 IMPs.  34-28.

After the 1NT opening (12-14 HCP, no 4-card major unless 4333) and 
3S overcall and two passes, Yves sighed, entered a third pass, and
began to write the contract on his score sheet.  Meanwhile, Matt 
and I were moaning as GIB's simulation showed pass winning... then
winning by a bit... then tied... and finally losing, as GIB chose
a very aggressive reopening double as West.  It took a moment to
explain the situation, but Yves was quite happy to undo the pass,
enter double, and watch his program back into 4S!  +450 for WBridge5.

This should have been another relay auction, but the wheels fell
off again.  Opener's 1C was 15+, his first pass was 18+, his 2C
was 22+, and subsequent bidding was natural.  Fortunately, GIB's
natural bidding is pretty reasonable as well, and it reached the
cold slam.  South felt that his HA and trump KT6 ought to be worth
two tricks and doubled.  No such luck; +1090 for GIB.

{
What do you rebid as South?  This is part of standard bidding 
I've never understood; 2H isn't fourth suit forcing, and the last
time I tried it on a similar collection, my expert partner jumped
to 4H and chided me afterwards.  Yet 3NT risks a silly contract
opposite club shortness; and even if you're willing to risk it
on this hand, you'd still have a problem on KJxxx.AJx.Axx.xx.  
Anwyay, WBridge5's 2NT rebid seems unduly conservative.

Also, what do you lead as West?  GIB's HK lead looks wrong, but
really, nothing looks especially appealing.  The CJ looks like the
least of evils, but I may be influenced by seeing all four hands.

11 tricks are possible on the HK lead, but WBridge5 blocked the
diamonds by leading the 8 (rather than the 10) to the king, and
then another by overtaking the SQ with the SK, squandering the
entry to hand.  It ended with nine tricks, +150.

The 2H opening was a natural and wild weak two, 2-9 HCP, 5+ hearts.
West relayed twice, learning that partner had a maximum with three
spades and five hearts, and signed off in 4H.

WBridge5 led a trump to the queen and ace.  GIB played a club to the
jack and ace; a club came back to the queen and king, and WBridge5
played the CT; GIB ruffed with the HA, drew trumps, finessed the SQ,
and claimed five, +450.  Playing back the C8 holds it to four, but
there's no way to beat it.

1H was 8-15.  East's reopening 1NT was about 14-16, so West had no
trouble raising to game (after first checking for four spades via 
Stayman).  However, at this table it was played from the unlucky 
side; 3NT can be beat when played by East, but not by West.

However, after GIB led a diamond (right!) and returned a club to the
ace (wrong!), the contract was makeable.  After winning the second
diamond in hand, declarer has to play a heart.  South must duck, and
declarer switches back to spades, eventually taking three spades, 
a heart, two diamonds, and three clubs.

Would you have gotten this right?  WBridge5 didn't, taking the spade
hook first; North played back another diamond, setting up South's
thirteenth diamond as the setting trick.  -50, and another 10 IMPs
for GIB, 78-28.

I'd have devalued the West hand to 14 points and opened 1NT, but
GIB apparently thought it was worth a 15+ 1C opener.  East responded
2C (8-11 balanced), West rebid 2NT (15-16 balanced, no 4-card major,
giving partner an out with a balanced 8), East raised to game.

Please don't ask me why GIB ditched the CQ under the CA, or why
WBridge5 then switched to the HA.  However, the par result was 
achieved; GIB ran its nine tricks for +600.

WBridge5 also thought that junk West hand was worth 15 points.  Hmm.

I have no explanation for GIB's unusual NT overcall as North, nor
for South's response of 3D rather than 3C.  On a double-dummy basis,
3D-X should go for 1100; E-W draw trumps and proceed to take their
nine tricks in notrump.  

However, defense is more difficult in real life.  West led a heart,
giving away one trick immediately.  Declarer won the queen in hand,
and played three rounds of clubs.  East ruffed the third round high,
and played a trump.  At this point West can play two rounds of trump
safely, but must then switch to avoid letting declarer set up a club;
but this is tough to find, not knowing that declarer started with
only two diamonds.  (Need good signals, here...)  At the table he
played three rounds of trump, then cashed the CJ, after which six
tricks were easy.  -500, and three rather lucky IMPs to GIB.

The score at the end of the segment was 81-28.  After including
the 11-IMP carryover, GIB was leading by 64 IMPs.

1D was 8-15, 4+ spades, 0-3 hearts; 2D was Druryish, 11+ points
and 3+ spades.  This was followed by a bunch of poor competitive
judgement: West's raise to 3H (rather than 2H) with so much stuff
in the opponent's suit, South's 3S balance (rather than double)
with only three small support for partner's probable four-card
suit, West's failure to double 3S, East's pushing on to 4H, and
South's failure to double 4H.

Not impressive bidding by either program.  The upshot is that N/S
(GIB) went +100 on a deal where both sides were begging for -300.

Good competitive judgement, this time.  Both sides reached the

Remember the 6C deal in the first set where the wheels came off?
Same bug.  500 deals of tests and 100 deals of play go uneventfully,
and in the finals, Good Father Murphy gives us *two* boards with
a seven-card major and 3-4 RP opposite a strong club.  Isn't that
always the way things go?

On this hand, North showed less than a positive response, then a
semipositive with spades, then 5+ spades and secondary clubs (!),
then realized it didn't have clubs after all, got confused, and
passed 3D!

Fortunately, nobody taught East not to double the only contract
you can beat.  North decided that playing a doubled 2-1 fit wasn't
such a hot idea after all, and GIB stumbled into its best contract.

Guessing the spades right, GIB took 13 tricks, for +510.

4H isn't as good a contract as 4S; perhaps North should rebid the
spades and see if partner raises.  I suspect WBridge5 would have
guessed the spades correctly anyway, but with GIB helpfully playing
the queen on the second round, it didn't have to.  +510, no swing.


How many tricks do you think West can make in spades, double-dummy?
No fair consulting your own copy of GIB. :)

1D was 8-15 with 4+ S, 0-3 H; East relayed, West showed diamonds (2C),
and East showed a strong invitation with 3-4 spades (2S).  West made
a very poorly judged 3H rebid, showing the fragment for no particular
reason, and East signed off in 3S.

With clubs unbid, South's club lead was more than reasonable, but it
removed the guess of whether to take the club finesse on the actual
lie of the cards.  GIB played a diamond, won by North's king; North
returned a heart to partner's king, and South played a heart back;
and GIB crossruffed, eventually losing a trick to the SK for +170
and 3 IMPs.  (Double-dummy, declarer can actually make *five*;
tricky, very tricky.)

One of the items on GIB's to-do list is implementing an "impurity
metric" for preempts.  East's suit and general strength are OK
for a favorable weak jump overcall, but he has *far* too much 
strength outside his suit, and the four-card major is also bad.
But even after the WJO, GIB should have reached 3NT; the 3D rebid
after partner's cuebid (17+ with support) is inexcusable.

WBridge5 found the same misdefense as GIB, catching air with the HA.
Making five, +150, 6 IMPs to WBridge5, trailing 8-6.

WBridge5 opened a strong notrump as East, and that was that.  Should
North reopen?  (GIB plays ASTRO in both direct and reopening seats,
for what it's worth; I could see an argument for using something like
DONT in reopening seat, where you're less likely to be able to
effectively use a penalty double.)

I'm awful at analyzing this sort of complicated partscore.  GIB says
its H9 lead gives away the contract; but when WBridge5 wins the HJ
and plays two rounds of clubs, and North wins the CA and plays back
a small spade, declarer needs to hop with the SK to take seven tricks.
I don't think I'd find it, and neither did WBridge5.  -100.

GIB devalued the QT doubleton and didn't open a strong club.  After
1H-P-P, how would you reopen as North?  I can see arguments for double,
2D, and 2NT (if unusual).  Double would probably land you in 1H-X, for
a likely +200, and 2D would probably get you +90.  2NT gets you to 3C
or 3D, which are nasty little contracts.  (Why are both GIB and WBridge5
responding 3D to 2NT with 2-2 minors?  3C is the right bid, isn't it?)

I'm punting on the analysis.  WBridge5 went down one, -50, losing
4 IMPs and trailing 12-6.

I was shocked by GIB's 4H bid.  However, a takeout double in this
position isn't currently defined in GIB's database; and if forced to
choose between P, 3N, 4H, or 5m, it's a pretty close choice between P
and 4H.  Given our very light opening-bid requirements, partner could
easily have a 10-count with heart support where game is cold yet not
be able to bid over 2S; knowing that the HK is probably onside also
suggests optimism.  The simulation turns up a few -1100's, but lots 
of +650's and +500's as well.  The real answer is to tell GIB what
double means here, of course.

4H could go for 500, but who can double?  I can't fault East for
taking the push to 4S, which got doubled and lost the obvious four
tricks for -200.

N-S never found hearts at this table; North should make a negative
double rather than raising the diamonds, I think.  Meanwhile, GIB
decided that AJ7652 wasn't a good enough suit for a vulnerable WJO,
but that it had the general values for a 1S overcall.  I'm not sure
if I like that logic.  A 2S overcall of one of a minor is a very
strong call, especially when your opponents are playing five-card
majors, and it should be made very aggressively.

Declarer lost the same four tricks, but at this table that was +140,
and a 8-IMP pickup for GIB.  20-6.

Yves had not prepared extensive defenses to Moscito, but that worked
to his advantage here; WBridge5 was able to bid 2S as a natural weak
jump overcall of our 1D opening (showing 8-15 with spades)!  Together
with the 3H response, this effectively silenced E-W.  3H lost a trump,

The North hand looks more like a 2-bid than a 1-bid to me, even with
our light openings, but GIB is currently programmed to open all 5RP
long-major hands with one-bids when nonvulnerable.  Looking at this
wretched North hand, I might have to loosen that constraint a little.

South relayed, North showed diamonds, and South broke the relay chain
with 2H, showing about 13-15 HCP and 3-4 hearts.  For no good reason,
North invited with 3H rather than passing, ending the auction.  With
the 5-0 trump split, this went down two on complicated play, -100.

Fortunately for WBridge5, they missed the 5-3 heart fit; seven tricks
are easy at notrump, eight tricks on anything but a club lead.  When
East led the DJ and pitched the S8 on partner's heart return, declarer
could set up spades without letting East in for a club switch, making
*ten* tricks.  +180, 7 IMPs to WBridge5, now leading 21-20.

WBridge5 plays very constructive weak two bids, and elected to pass
the East hand.  GIB opened 1D as South (8-15, 4+ S, 0-3 H), bid a 
Drury-ish 2D as North (11+, 3+ S), and signed off in 2S as South.
Declarer lost two spades, a heart, and a diamond, for +140.

Opposite a passed hand, GIB's 1NT opener shows 13-16 HCP, still no
four-card major unless 4333.  South's raise was pushy but reasonable,
as it pays to avoid 2NT contracts whenever possible.  A boring +430.

Should South investigate slam opposite the 12-14 1NT opening? 
It's probably worth looking if you have the methods, but Moscito Byte's
1NT structure is still basic Stayman-and-transfers; we haven't jazzed
it up yet.  Facing a misfit, with no intermediates, prospects look
pretty dim; I think GIB did well to ignore the pointcount and sign
off in 3NT.  The play was boring, +630.

weak 1NT opener.  Many many gifts of tricks were kindly given back

2S was a simple raise, about 7-10 points and 3+ spades; WBridge5 
aggressively balanced as South, reaching a close 3C contract.
I don't think going up with the DA at trick two is right, but 
on the lie of the cards, the contract was always going down one.

South's 3D bid was part of Lebensohl, asking for a four-card major but
denying a stopper.  North, with neither a major, a stopper, or long
clubs, was stuck.  He settled on 3S, was raised to 4, and doubled.

This can be beat two tricks, but the defense has to play a forcing
game.  When East switched to a heart after cashing DA, that cost one
trick, and when he ruffed GIB's play of a club from hand, that cost
another.  Declarer ruffed East's diamond return high in dummy, pulled
two rounds of trumps, ruffed another diamond low (West unable to
overruff), played a heart back to hand, pulled the last trump, and
played a club.  West had only clubs remaining, and had to concede two
tricks to dummy's club KQ and good heart.  That made three trumps,
four hearts, one club, and two diamond ruffs, for 10 tricks; +590.

A bundle of paradoxes!  The defense has five top tricks against 3NT,
but the contract is cold, because they don't have the communication
to take them.  Yet WBridge5 went down, and it was right to do so!

East cashed four top diamonds.  WBridge5 threw two small clubs from
dummy... but what should be the third discard?  Throwing a third
club works on the actual layout, but if clubs *aren't* 7-0, it 
gives away three or four extra undertricks.  The IMP odds are 
only 10-4 or 10-5 in favor of playing to make, and the 7-0 split
is surely less likely than that.

WBridge duly threw a heart, conceding down one, -50.  12 IMPs to GIB,
which had won the session 44-22.

Strange 4H raise by WBridge5 as South.  This is an awkward contract,
and I'm not sure what the best line is after the club lead.  Knock
out the spade ace, unblocking the SK; if they return a diamond or
spade, take the heart ace-king and start running spades, keeping a 
trump in dummy for an entry when they ruff in; but what if they 
return a club instead, tapping dummy?

At the table, WBridge5 immediately attacked spades, but failed to
unblock the SK.  The contract was now beatable, since after winning
the DK return, declarer had to play the SK before cashing top hearts;
East could play a diamond to partner's queen and get a third spade
through declarer, promoting the HQ for the setting trick.  However,
GIB didn't find the defense, playing a third diamond for no good
reason; an undistinguished -420.

Right strain, wrong level.  South took a conservative view; his
sequence showed 11-13, unbalanced, and at least five spades, which
is perhaps an underbid considering the quality of the spades and 
the fit for partner's hearts.  (Bo-Yin's notes have a system bid
for this hand; 2C, then 2S, then 3H, to show an invitational hand
with 6-3 majors; but I hadn't gotten around to coding it yet.  Foo.)

+200, and 6 IMPs to WBridge5.

Favorable in first seat, East's hand is far from a minimum weak two

well not to raise.  The defenders took all their tricks and then 
some.  West did well to switch to spades before giving partner his
diamond ruff, and when declarer lost the club hook trying to ditch
a spade, the defense ended with seven tricks.  A nice +300 for GIB.

By contrast, the North hand is a pretty normal unfavorable "weak"
jump overcall.  When GIB raised to 3H as South for no good reason,
it was scheduled for a similar result; but WBridge5 came to the 
rescue with a weird 3S balance by the East hand.  If you're going
to bid that hand, best to do it early. 

3S is a silly contract which happens to be cold as the cards lie;
but still, -140 was 4 IMPs for GIB, trailing 6-4.

1C was 15+, 1D was 0-8, 1H was natural, pass over 1H was 18+, and
everything else was natural.  The 3H balance seems poorly judged,
but not nearly as poorly judged as East's 3S balance (rather than
double, probably +300).  GIB ended up in 4C, down one, -100.

Computers often don't handle freaks well, as programmer effort is more
usefully concentrated on more common hands, and they have very little
resembling "common sense".

This might be a good example.  I say "might" rather than "is".  It's
vaguely possible that GIB as East realized that it shouldn't bounce
the bidding and push the opponents into 4S (on their known 10-card fit,
as 1H denied spades), It's also vaguely possible that WBridge as North
made an informed judgement not to push on against the partscore, vul,
knowing that the high cards and any opposing spades would be on its
left (1S was a 13+ relay) and hoping for heart length with partner.

But somehow I doubt it.  Anyway, +170 for GIB.  (BTW, note WBridge5's
play of the DK on the first round of diamonds... that's an excellent
play, unlikely to lose a trick and necessary to avoid getting endplayed
on some layouts.)

1C was 15+, and double showed general values.  GIB probably should have 
raised to 4S as South, but having passed, it did well to realize what 
a huge hand it held on the bidding and redouble 4S.

At first glance it looks like this might lose four tricks.  But after
the HA lead, East was endplayed at trick two!  On the DA exit, declarer
ended up pitching a small club on the DJ, losing only a heart and a 
diamond; making five!  +1430 the hard way.  It takes a low diamond
or a club shift to hold it to four.  Of course, the hand's always
cold; the defense can never play diamonds, and with the CK onside,
the CQ is available for a diamond discard.

16 IMPs to GIB, bouncing back into a 20-12 lead.

West opened a 17+ 1C (sounder openings in 3rd/4th seat) and relayed;
East showed 8+ points, 4-7 RP, no major, and diamonds (1N), secondary
clubs and a spade splinter (2N), 1354 shape (3D), and 7 RP (4C).
West signed off in 4H.

You might ask why West relayed over 3D, if he was planning to sign
off over partner's most favorable response.  I could tell you that
GIB prefers to keep relaying in such situations as long as it's safe
and the responding hand will be dummy, because it prevents the enemy
from drawing inferences about the nature of declarer's (relayer's)
hand.  Unfortunately, this would be a lie.

The real answer is that it's difficult for GIB to figure out what
information will be useful to it for making decisions on future rounds
of bidding, so for the time being, we tell it to relay any time it can
survive partner's response.  (More or less.  Details are beyond the
scope of this article, and besides, I'm about to change them. :) )

This seemed like a good spot for a digression on relay methods, 
because the play was utterly boring.  +480.

1D was 8-15, 4+ spades, 0-3 hearts.  1H is a waiting bid, sort of like
a forcing notrump; it systemically denies four spades and shows about
6-12 points.

However, GIB has consistently refused to pass 1D holding very weak
hands with spade support and no diamond suit, and usually opts for
1H instead.  If it were a human, we'd say that it had an implicit
partnership agreement to bid 1H on such hands, and would require it
to disclose this agreement.  But it's not human, and not only is it
incapable of forming such an agreement (it will *never* play partner
for four spades on this auction), it is completely unaware of partner's
history and is thus incapable of disclosing it to the opponents!  

I'd argue that GIB should be treated like a human who is playing 
a known system with a new partner each session (or deal!), but then,
it could also be argued that bridge officials shouldn't have to pay
attention to the details of how a program works; there exist other
programs which *do* learn partner's behavior over time.  What a mess.
I'll leave this one to the rules lawyers.

The way around this particular case is to redefine 1H, but other cases
will surely come up; for example, I've seen GIB frequently respond with 
very shaded forcing notrump responses in standard, hoping to improve
the contract or keep the opponents out.  (I've seen experts do the
same thing, suggesting that GIB has the right idea.)

Anyway, back to the deal.  It seems like WBridge5 should have entered
the auction at some point as South, in the balancing seat if not
immediately, but it chose not to.  The defense collected one of each
major, two of each minor, and a diamond ruff for +200.

The club lead was less attractive at this table facing a 1C opener,
and GIB tried a diamond shift rather than a club when in with the HA.

1C was 15+, and X was a double negative, 0-5 or so.  East's choice to
compete to 3D over 2H was very poorly judged, vulnerable against not,
but South's failure to either double 3D or pass partner's double 
(+500!) was even more so.  This is partly because GIB was confused
by the auction; it thought the overcaller had five diamonds, the 
balancer had four diamonds, and partner had promised a couple of 
diamonds with the double -- there were too many diamonds at the table!  
We need to do something about progressively relaxing GIB's constraints 
on the other hands rather than simply abandoning them when things get 
confusing.  3H was not a comfortable contract, and went down one;
-50 meant 5 more IMPs to WBridge5, now down 33-24.

One of those rare auctions where you actually need a scorecard to tell
the players apart; both tables started 1H-P-2H-X.  Here responder was
the one with an extra trump, so South bid his spades before the
opponents got up to 3H.  North raised to 3S, naturally, and GIB made
the marginal decision to bid game as South, expecting the same general
strength (17+) opposite but hoping for heart shortness, less spade
duplication, or general extras.  No such luck, but -100 was still 
a 2-IMP pickup.  36-24.

Here you don't need a scorecard.  West relayed a bunch, East showed
4135 with 7 RP and honors in both black suits but not in diamonds,
West chose 4H.  The simulation says that on the available knowledge,
5D is a slightly better bid at total points, but 4H is better at IMPs.
I guess GIB wanted that one IMP for +420 vs. +400... should we tell 
it something about not taking chances when sitting on a big lead?

Even with the 5-1 heart break, 4H was cold.  When WBridge5 failed to
force the 6-5 hand with repeated spade leads, it made five.  +450.

WBridge5's 2C overcall was Landy, and pretty aggressive even at the
favorable vulnerability.  3C was... um... Stayman.  (Like I said,
the 1NT structure has *not* been revamped...)

3NT scored +630, losing 1 IMP.  How do you like West's chances at
2H doubled?  That would have gone down *five*, for -1100.  Yow.

WBridge5 apparently doesn't open 1NT with a five-card major.  After the
1H opening, when 2C came around, it made a good decision to sell out.
Was GIB was playing safe to make two, or just misplaying?  +90.

GIB doesn't have the option of rebidding 1H after the strong club with
a balanced hand and five hearts, because that would be a relay.  This
can go down as many as four, but when the defenders kept playing on
hearts, declarer was able to escape with three heart winners and two
spade winners for down two.  -200, 3 IMPs to WBridge5.  37-28.

Mike Whitaker of Blue Chip Bridge was kibitzing this hand, and sighed
as GIB kept bidding and bidding.  "Sheesh.  1D, 1H, 1S, 2D, pass."
"You'd pass 2D?"  "Well, maybe 2N, 3D, pass."

GIB had a bit more trouble.  The 2C response showed 8-11 balanced.
West probably should have bid 2S here (minimum, 4+ spades, 0-3 hearts,
not game forcing) but chose to relay instead.  2S showed longer hearts
than spades, over which West began to smell misfit, but had nowhere
convenient to go; 3C and 3D would imply longer suits.  3N showed a
3442 minimum, 4D showed exactly 5 RP, and West finally bailed out.

With the SQ onside and the DQ dropping, 4D made exactly.  +130.

The 1NT response showed about 8-12 HCP with 5-6 hearts, the heart
quality limited by failure to respond 2H.  (KTxxxx is possible, KQTxxx
is not.)  West's book bid is pass, but GIB instead chose to sign off
in 2H, and thought it was clear-cut to do so.  I'll have to take a
look at the trace sometime and find out why... It seems like an odd
decision when you know you're probably playing a 5-2.

When the defenders took air with the CA and removed the diamond guess
for declarer, the play became easy; +140.

I'm not sure what motivated WBridge5's 2S rebid at this table.  
Unlike 2H, 2S can be beaten, but it takes a club lead; GIB didn't
find it.  Some subsequent friendliness in the trump suit let 
declarer make nine tricks, for +140 and another push.

GIB had won the third set by 37-28, and was now leading by 95 IMPs
after 58 boards.  (At the table, we had the difference as 101 IMPs;
I think this figure is correct.)

Yves declined to play the final six boards, so that was that.  GIB was
once again the winner of the world computer bridge championships.
