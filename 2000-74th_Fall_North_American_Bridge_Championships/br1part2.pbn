{
If you absolutely want to open the South hand in 3rd position,
what's wrong with 1S? Meyers thought her hand looked more like
a weak two bid and used the partnerships' bid for such a hand:
a Multi 2D. Mohan's 2S said he didn't want to go further opposite
spades, but that he was willing to bid at least 3H opposite hearts.
Since he could be almost certain that Meyers had spades, that
information could only be useful to the opponents.

[Declarer "E"]
{
Some people have lower requirements for a 3-level preempt than
I have... And since Kales was willing to be in 7D opposite king-queen
of diamonds, he surely expected a seventh diamond opposite. When
Probst only had six, and Meyers attacked East-West's weakest
side-suit, there was some work to do. But when all suits broke
evenly, he emerged with twelve tricks. Just made: plus 920. On
a heart lead, declarer may easily go down: HA, DA, CJ, DK, DJ
to the queen, another heart.

[Declarer "S"]
{
N/S, with significant wasted highcards in the black suits, overreached
to 4H. When the C10 lead lost to declarer's queen and a spade
came back, Stuart must have thought that it was important to
start trumps to prevent a crossruff. Had Gray held the HA rather
than the DA, he would have been right to take the line he did.
But on the actual lie of the cards the HK shift ended up looking
rather foolish.

[Declarer "E"]
{
Stuart's 3S bid looks rather conservative when, opposite as little
as king-jack-fifth of spades, game would be odds on. As it was,
with Gray holding the CA in addition to the requisite trump holding,
the spade slam was cold -- even if it was a bit lucky that Gray
held nothing wasted in diamonds.

{
West's 2C response showed hearts, and East just bid the game
on slender high card values. After ruffing the second round of
spades and a losing trump finesse, declarer, Versace, got a chance
to test the clubs as well as the diamonds when North returned
a trump. He played a club to the king and tried three rounds
of diamonds. When the DQ came down, he could cross to dummy in
hearts, pulling the last outstanding trump, and run the diamonds
for an overtrick.

[Contract "3C"]
[Declarer "S"]
{
With the CK onside, only an initial spade lead (or a top diamond
followed by a spade shift) could stop 3NT. Better still (except
at pairs), 5C is cold. North's dilemma in the auction was that
a 2C response would have been a game force, and it might also
make it more difficult to find a heart fit at a comfortable level.
Remember that N/S open ten counts when not vulnerable.

[Declarer "S"]
{
Mohan's redouble seems to have convinced E/W that it was N/S's
hand. So, when he "saved" in 5D, E/W were convinced not to say
"Double." This was especially effective since a double would
have netted E/W a cool 800 against their unbiddable slam (which
depends only on guessing the spade position correctly). E/W's
plus 300 should yield N/S almost all of the matchpoints.

{
Looking at Meyers' hand, we would say her 2C bid showed the majors.
Mohan, not the victim of matchpoint mania on this one, still
preferred to play in his minor: diamonds. It looks as though
E/W should have found a way to double anything N/S bid but here
Bresnahan settled for a quiet 2NT. Thank's Frank. Still, with
a maximum of 17 HCP it is puzzling why Pyles didn't carry on
to game.

nothing to strike fear into declarer's heart. Meyers ducked the
SK to preserve her side entry to her hearts, and declarer abandoned
the suit and crossed to the CA to finesse the DQ.

[Contract "4H"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
West was a bit aggressive with his 2S bid (3D looks about right
to us) and subsequently drove his side to 4H. With four top losers
and the HK still to find, N/S had no trouble going plus. The
big question was: could North provide South with a diamond ruff?
Meyers cashed her SAK and shifted to a club and Mohan took his
two top tricks in that suit. Mohan now had a problem. He had
to return a diamond to give Meyers a diamond ruff when he got
in with his HK but if Meyers had the D8, declarer would be locked
in dummy and would have to bang the HA, dropping his offside
stiff king.

[Declarer "E"]
{
Looking at the E/W hands only, 3S does not look like a bad contract
at all. Indeed, even 4S has chances, albeit very slim ones. On
this layout, however, declarer lost the first six tricks, going
two down. As he was not doubled, this result may be all right
because N/S can in fact make 3C. They would only lose a spade,
two diamonds, and a heart as only two hearts can be ruffed in
dummy.

{
A disciplined auction in which Mohan made a game try and Meyers
declined, landing them in an excellent 3H-contract. Notice, though,
that the defense could go wrong and give up an overtrick, e.g.,
after a club lead and a diamond shift rather than a spade shift.
Declarer would win the DA, pull TWO rounds of trumps, and knock
out the other club honor.
