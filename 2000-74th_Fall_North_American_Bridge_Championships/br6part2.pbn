{
The next opponents for our sitting pair are the young Israeli
partnership of Schneider & Roll, who will be appearing later
in the week in the Reisinger as part of the e-bridge junior squad.
With a combined age of 50, they must surely be one of the yougest
pairs ever to reach the final of the Blue Ribbon Pairs. Gawrys/Morris
conducted a routine auction to 4H on this board and the defenders
cashed their two aces. N/S plus 450, surely one of the flattest
boards of the event.

{
Josef Roll started proceedings with a mini 1NT and Gawrys overcalled
showing both Majors. West's double expressed interest in a penalty
but, when his partner could not double, Schneider decided that
doing so would not be right action. Roll interpreted 2NT as showing
two places to play, and when East removed to 3C Gawrys might
have doubled to leave his partner an option (inspired defense:
HA, heart ruff would set 3C doubled 300), but Morris would surely
have bid 3S himself. Whether West was intending to convert to
3H we shall never know, as Gawrys competed to 3S, hoping for
a fourth trump opposite.

{
Morris' 3S was a splinter raise, showing a big fit for clubs.
Gawrys had a fair hand for slam and a heart flaw for notrump,
but he settled for 3MT, which would most often be the money contract

{
WOW!! When the bidding came around to him at the three-level,
Gawrys' decision to make a vulnerable overcall on a truly moth-eaten
spade suit would not have been everybody's choice. Having said
that, both pass and double are equally flawed in their own way.
North had a routine raise to game and Rosenkranz an equally obvious
double of 4S. Had West reasoned, "I have three trump tricks,
let's cash my ace quickly" he might then have continued with
a second club, allowing his partner to score his singleton trump.

{
After East, playing a club system, opened a slightly-shaded 1H
in second seat, Gawrys had several "normal" actions available
to him, including pass and a takeout double, but instead he overcalled
1NT, feigning a heart stopper. After West, with all the missing
strength, doubled for penalties, confusion set in.

{
The E/W club system called for East to open a limited 1H with
his weak four-card suit. A strong jump shift to 2S, if available,
might have led to the good slam. West's 2NT response, apparently,
was an artificial forcing raise of hearts, and East's 3C rebid
was most likely a further description of his hand, rather than
shortness (the reply to the usual form of Jacoby 2NT) or a cue
bid showing the ace (an interesting alternative).

{
A normal auction to a sound contract. Some might overcall 1NT
with the East hand, but double is more flexible and seems preferable
with this spade holding. Upon seeing dummy, declarer expected
to take five diamonds, three hearts and a spade. However, the
contract was unmakable due to the four-zero diamond break.

{
Major two-suiters seem to be the theme of this final session.
Many pairs do not use a two-suited overcall with hands of intermediate
strength but we do not know whether Gawrys-Morris are graduates
of that school or simply do not play a version of Michaels. Here
Gawrys bid both his suits and caught a raise to game.

{
East was not going to let a little thing like vulnerability get
in his way. He bid a hopeful 4S after having shown his clubs.
He had a bit going for him in that South had not made a negative
double and, after all, it is a bidders' game. Over 4S, South
thought he had two spade tricks and so doubled, as would everyone
else.

{
West's 2S response to the strong NT was Minor Suit Stayman. North
took a big shot with 4S and East was only too happy to double
that. With best defense it goes four down (four spades, two diamonds
and one heart), but West was looking for bigger game. His 5S
was a cue bid asking asking partner to PLEASE pick a minor! East
had a clear choice and and 6C was the final contract. South knew
that West was void of spades, and tried a heart.
