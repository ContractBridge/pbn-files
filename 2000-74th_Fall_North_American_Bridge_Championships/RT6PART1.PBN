{
The last round of a tough teams event --- exciting stuff! This
evening we follow the exploits of the primary exponents of Washington
Standard. On the first round they draw some neighbours. Bragging
rights at stake here. E/W gave nothing up on the bidding, reaching
3NT briskly. When in at trick three with the SQ, South had to
make a tough choice. If West had three spades, it was imperative
to get diamonds going, and West's choice to win the CQ at trick
one (which revealed the honor position to South) sent a mixed
message to Boyd about the urgency for a diamond switch.

{
N/S conducted a nice controlled auction to 4S. After starting
with a strong and artificial 2C bid, North showed his suits.
Once he got delayed support with no encouragement, Robinson settled
for game. For a moment it looked like he had found the perfect
dummy. All five points were working! He ruffed the second club,
cashed two diamonds, crossed to the HQ and pitched his heart
loser.

{
East made a negative double over North's 1H overcall. Some partnerships
play that this denies four spades (else bid 1S with four) but
it is more popular in North America to "guarantee" four spades.
Double looks good to me in both scenarios [JG]. It would seem
that West was expecting a fourth spade because he pushed on to
2S over North's 2H with an ugly collection. The defense can beat
2H by leading a spade or a heart.

East's 2D showed at least five hearts, but did not promise a
rebid. Are more transfer-like bids the wave of the future? When
West showed a sixth spade, East knew where he wanted to play.
Duboin ruffed the first trick (CQ covered by CK and CA) and crossed
to dummy's HA to start trumps.

East opened a "Kamikaze" (10-12 HCP) 1NT. N/S play the Woolsey
Notrump Defense: South's 2D showed a one-suiter in either major.
West, unconcerned, jumped to 3NT. With the CK onside and (at
least) one of the missing spade honors onside, twelve tricks
were easy for declarer. Making six: N/S minus 490. The vulnerability
was favorable for E/W. Unless E/W play a double as artificial,
West would have done better to double 2D to create a force and
suggest doubling the runout. [DK]

{
East's 1C was forcing: natural, (most often) 12-14 HCP balanced
in this position, or any game force. West's 1D showed four or
more hearts. As neither East nor West had extra values, neither
could compete over North's 1S overcall. South was a hair short
of raising [the SQ instead of a low one, or a third spade, would
have sufficed---DK], so North played in 1S. It looks safe to
lead from a suit like QJ102, but it wasn't.

{
With eleven HCP opposite eleven, Boyd/Robinson stopped in 2NT.
You would not expect 3NT to be a good contract, and it isn't,
but with diamonds three-three and the queen onside, declarer
has nine tricks. Boyd led a club towards the KJx and Seamon hopped
up with the CA and the defenders took their four tricks. NS plus
150. This is likely to be a tied board.

[Declarer "S"]
{
In theory, the two pairs achieved absolute par on this deal.
Passell opened with a Multi - this time a weak two-bid in spades
- and Seamon responded with a non-forcing relay (prepared to
play in 2H opposite a weak 2H). Boyd knew what was going on,
and bid what he thought he could make - 4H. When that came back
to Seamon he backed in with 4S, now knowing that his side had
a 10-card fit in that suit.

[Declarer "W"]
{
Passell-Seamon bid quickly to 4S, a contract that will be reached
via the same auction at most tables in the final. Most defenders
will find the heart lead, as Robinson did. After taking two heart
tricks, it was obvious for Boyd to switch to a club. But Passell
guessed right, as most declarers will - looking at such strong
diamonds in dummy, it may be too risky for South to underlead
the ace at this form of scoring.

{
E/W bid very well to get to the top spot. Bates showed extras
with his 3C rebid. This "high level reverse" is bid only with
good hands, because East would rebid 2S with a minimum. Smith
set spades as the key suit, and after receiving the heart cue-bid
he was looking for, tried RKC Blackwood. East showed three key
cards (the 2 missing aces and the SK) with 5C and then the SQ
- but no other king - with his 6S bid. West could see a good
play for 13 tricks with diamonds running and bid the grand slam
in notrump.

[Contract "2H"]
[Declarer "S"]
{
Boyd's textbook weak 2H in first seat finished the bidding. E/W
can make 2S but I can't see how they would get there. If either
East or West had found a bid, spades would be played at a much
higher level. South elected not to go to dummy and play a club
to his king. With the ace on his left, that was the correct view.
When E/W cleared clubs and played a second spade, South was in
control. But at trick nine, when Boyd played a diamond from dummy,
he pitched his club rather than ruff with the 10.

[Contract "3H"]
[Declarer "S"]
{
When the E/W bidding came back to Boyd, he made a fine balancing
bid of 3H. The spotlight shifted to Robinson. Should he bid game?
He has a very good hand and partner is vulneable. Conventional
wisdom says that when partner balances, you do not punish him
because he already has bid your values. Be thankful for what
you have. Robinson passed, the disciplined action. As luck would
have it, four was cold and when Smith did not lead or switch
to trumps in time, Boyd made five legitimately. How?

{
N/S play Support Doubles even at the three-level, an unusual
treatment, so North was able to show three-card spade support
by doubling West's weak 3D jump. North's second double showed
extra high-card strength; South, short in diamonds and without
defense, was right to pull. A case could be made for South to
bid 4H rather than 4S, catering to North's having four hearts,
but as it happens, 4H could fail on a spade lead and a couple
of ruffs.

South discarded his D2. East surrendered the unavoidable heart
loser to North, as South discarded a spade. Taking the next diamond
with dummy's DA, declarer crossed to the CA to run two more hearts.

{
Playing a Two-Over-One Game Force system, East responded to West's
1S with a forcing 1NT that concealed extra values. Were those
extra values enough to force to game? Not if West were short
in clubs. However, once West bid 2C showing three or more, East
could tell that the CK and CQ weren't wasted. Stronger action
than her invitational 3S was in order. 2/1 GF players would do
well to consider responder's rebids when opener's reply to a
forcing 1NT promotes responder's hand to game values.
