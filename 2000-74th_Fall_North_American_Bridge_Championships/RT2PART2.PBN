North, in first seat, passed a hand that most players open these
days. East  rebid her spades when Smith balanced with 2D. Both
sides had undiagnosed double fits and stopped bidding much too
soon.

{
The bidding was short and sweet. Two diamonds showed a three
suited hand with short diamonds and 11 to 15 points. 3NT was
to play. The lead gave nothing away and Compton went about setting
up her ninth trick. Smith won the diamond, played a heart to
partner's king. Once the diamond  ace was dislodged, she had
nine tricks. On the run of dummy's major suits, Compton played
for a diamond-club squeeze.

[Declarer "S"]
{
Facing favorable vulnerability South preempted 3D in the partnership's
featherweight style. North surmised that, despite his own opening
bid strength, E/W had game. He messed around with 3NT in hopes
of being allowed to play undoubled, but East had too good a hand
to be deterred. South, perhaps ashamed of his preempt, pulled
to 4D before North could. East doubled again, this time for takeout,
and West found their four-four heart fit. When North took the
5D save, East doubled for penalties.

[Declarer "N"]
{
North and South had a combined 25 HCP, enough to provide reasonable
play for the 3NT they reached on what is nowadays a fairly usual
auction. East's club lead gave declarer a trick with the CK,
and a chance to make 3NT with lucky breaks and good guesses (playing
East for a doubleton or tripleton SQ, and hearts to split 3-3),
but declarer spurned this chance and led the DK to West's DA.

[Declarer "N"]
{
Hands like North's yearn to be opened, yet fall short of standard
opening-bid thresholds. In some European methods, they can be
shown by conventional two-suited two-bids. When East's standard
weak 2S bid came around, North had no way to show his two-suiter.
A 3S Michaels cue bid is too dangerous, so he balanced with 3D,
his good 6-card suit. [It would be a good idea to use 2NT by
a passed hand as "Michaels" over a weak 2S---DK.]

[Declarer "W"]
{
Over 1NT, North bid 2S, "DONT", to show a weak one-suiter. East,
playing negative doubles even here, could not double for penalties,
and therefore could not collect plus 300. When West replied 3C
to East's negative double, East had nowhere to go but 3NT. West
took North's SQ lead with the SA and ducked the S9 to North's
S10 to set up a third spade trick; South discarded an encouraging
diamond, then a discouraging club. [Keeping diamonds and throwing
clubs would be more effective--DK].

[Declarer "W"]
{
You can expect to find lots of failing contracts on this deal.
Against best defense, neither side can make more than plus 110,
but there is enough distribution to expect the bidding to continue
past the two-level. It is unclear whether East's redouble was
a tactical maneuvre, in an attempt to silence the opponents and
buy the contract cheaply, or a systemic spade raise. In either
event, Les Bart took the push over 3H, thus turning a plus into
a minus.

[Contract "1NT"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
After two passes, East must choose between opening an offshape
1NT or starting with 1D on a poor suit, which risks a nasty rebid
problem over a 1S response. On this layout, the 1D opening is
a big winner because partner will respond 1H, locating the four-four
fit. In hearts, declarer will score an easy ten tricks, assuming
the defenders take their diamond ruff, since West's spade losers
will later disappear on the long diamonds. Thanks to the favorable
diamond position, declarer can still make ten tricks, even on
a spade lead.

[Contract "3H"]
[Declarer "S"]
{
South's wafer-thin gambling 3H preempt on a 6-card suit at favorable
vulnerability handcuffed West. West could overcall 3NT, not particularly
comfortably. 3S on an ordinary 5-card suit would risk catching
a misfit, and wouldn't always get to game when game was on, for
East wouldn't be able to envision West as quite so strong. West
could expect to score more defending than declaring any partscore,
so she passed. It was South's gamble that paid off, as 4S was
cold.

[Contract "4HX"]
[Declarer "W"]
{
South had a typical hand for a second-seat 3C preempt with both
vulnerable. North made a gambling bid, risking minus 200 against
an opposing partscore, by raising to 4C. When 4C came back to
West, who was close to bidding 4H at her first turn, she took
the bait by bidding 4H now. I have great sympathy for West's
4H [DK]. She thought perhaps, that North had three clubs for
his raise, so placed East with a singleton.

The next E/W pair needs no introduction other than 'Meckwell'.
The first deal of the round is another that is likely to be flat
around the room. With a pair of balanced 14 counts, NS will universally
reach 3NT, and West's heart lead is also routine. After five
rounds of clubs, declarer knocks out the HA.

Meckstroth opened a Strong Club and unfavourable vulnerability
assured the opponents' silence. 1D was negative (0-7) and 1H
was natural and forcing; 1S is natural, 1NT was artificial, forcing;
2C was natural; 3H set trump. Rodwell's failure to cue-bid confirmed
his limited values. Thus the partnership did not venture beyond
game.

N/S have the balance of the HCP - barely - but they are well

and quite right he was too. Whichever side buys the contract
on this deal is likely to regret doing so. Neither side has a
fit and, if N/S declare, their trumps suit does not break. In
notrump, N/S may manage to scramble seven tricks, but probably
no more. E/W had the auction to themselves at our featured table
