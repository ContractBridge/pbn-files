[Vulnerable "None"]
[Contract "4H"]
[Declarer "W"]
{
After Versace's preemptive 3D, E/W bounced right into 4H - destined
to fail with the HK offside and three top losers in the minors.
Wexler's light but mainstream (today) overcall was not the operative
cause for Quinn's 3H (she would have made the same bid without
the overcall) but the nature of the auction was perhaps not thoroughly
clear to both partners. If Wexler had considered 3H nonforcing
she would have passed it.

[Declarer "N"]
{
3NT is the normal contract, with nine tricks on top and extra
tricks available in clubs, spades, or even hearts (if E/W attack
them). In fact, declarer was a threat to score eleven tricks
unless the defense cashed out. East's low heart lead gave Lauria
an immediate shot at an eleventh trick via the spade finesse
when Quinn inserted the H10 at trick one.

[Declarer "S"]
{
Versace could not bid on the first round because 1NT would have
been conventional, but he was able and willing to reopen with
a takeout double at his next turn. Pszczola, who might have bid
3S at his previous turn, did so now, but Lauria's cards were
working and he competed to the four-level, expecting to find
a true fit, but Versace converted to 4D, suggesting his actual
shape. Bingo!

[Declarer "E"]
{
Gawrys' was forcing for one round, usually with a balanced 12-14
HCP. Pszczola's 1D was a negative, and Gawrys' 1NT showed a balanced
hand with 18-20 HCP. When Lauria played the C2 (reverse count)
on the opening lead, Versace sensibly continued the suit to either
cash it out or to establish the long card as the setting trick
in case Lauria were to gain the lead. A diamond shift, which
would have held Gawrys to nine tricks, was virtually impossible
to find.

[Declarer "E"]
{
6D is cold, and it comes as no surprise that many times world
champions Martel and Stansby bid it without breathing hard. 2S
was at least invitational with four or more diamonds; 2NT showed
something in spades; 3C was natural and forcing; 3H natural or
(as here) heart values; 3S showed a good hand but denied a singleton;
4C and 4H were cue-bids; and 4NT denied a spade control.

[Contract "3H"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
The best E/W could do is defend 2S doubled. Versace had seven
apparent losers in that contract, but the defenders couldn't
lead diamonds without losing a trick. By establishing dummy's
fourth club in time, he would come to seven tricks. But Martel
wasn't willing to defend 2S, and so went on to 3H, in spite of
only four trumps and no fitting diamond honor.

[Declarer "W"]
{
Lauria's takeout double opposite a passed partner and with two
little cards in one of the unbid suits won't be found in any
textbook. Here, Horton became declarer in 3NT, when Helman took
the normal, aggressive course. On the low heart lead, Versace
stuck in the nine, hoping Lauria had ace-seven fourth, and returned
the HQ when he gained the lead in diamonds.

{
If you ever want to open a weak two-bid on a five-card suit,
the West hand is just right. And when Helman, inspired by the
vulnerability, introduced his spades, it was up to the great
Italians to sort things out. They didn't. Versace had no distribution,
but felt he was too strong to pass, and over his double Lauria
responded 2NT, meant as lebensohl (at most 7 HCP, requiring Versace
to rebid 3C unless he's very strong).

[Declarer "W"]
{
West's 2H call in the balancing seat over Lauria's 1NT opening
bid, showed hearts and a minor. Lauria began by cashing two spades
and the top trumps, then led a diamond. A club shift before cashing
trumps would have been better, for if declarer's minor is clubs,
South would be able to ruff, either directly, or on the second
round.

By agreement, West's 3C preempt showed a good suit (at least
three of the five honors). With 4441 shape Lauria would have
doubled, but facing a passed partner it was unsound to act with
what he had.
