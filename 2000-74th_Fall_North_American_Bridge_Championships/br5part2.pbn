{
Looking at all the hands, 3NT is precisely where E/W would like
to be. The heart lead set up two heart tricks for the defense
and one for declarer which, combined with nine tricks in the
minors, brought declarer's total to ten. The only way to get
an eleventh trick would be to steal one in spades before the
defense knew that declarer had five clubs. When Catlett came
in at trick three with the DJ, he immediately set out to steal
that eleventh trick.

{
At least nine tricks are available in 3NT on any lead (even a
spade) via two spades, three hearts, three diamonds and one club.
Double dummy, eleven tricks are available in 4H, where declarer
has to lose only one club and one trump. Even though the lead
found the SK for declarer, it was best for the defense. Soloway
lost the diamond finesse at trick two and froze the spades by
playing the S7 when Beatty returned a low one. Beatty erred by
covering the H10 at trick five, but Soloway had to duck anyway.

An easy auction to the normal 4S contract and three obvious losers:
two hearts and the SK. There is really no logical alternative
to the line of play that Levitina chose, and she ended with the
expected 10 tricks and an average result. Minus 620.

[Contract "6H"]
[Declarer "N"]
{
With a potential third-round spade loser and an 'almost sure'
diamond loser to worry about, Sutherlin's 4NT bid and subsequent
leap to slam seem overly aggressive. He was duly punished for
his actions when dummy appeared with the reverse minor-suit lengths
he needed. Even if Beatty was three-three in the minors, or had
one or two of his spades been clubs, the slam would still have
been unmakeable.

[Contract "4SX"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
A 3H preempt with North's weak suit at unfavorable vulnerability
seems quite normal nowadays. Of course, his intermediate hearts
were good, and those black singletons were quite irresistible.
It's hard to believe that South bid 4H for any other reason than
an advance sacrifice. The defense has no real chance as long
as declarer takes the club finesse.

{
Landen's double showed a three-card heart support and Sutherlin
would have done better to have gotten his "limit raise" values
with four trumps off his chest immediately by cue-bidding 2C.
When he chose to bid only 2S and E/W competed to 3H, he felt
obliged to bid again, and Pratap was justified in doubling 3S.

{
Sutherlin decided not to bid the spade game which would have
been beaten quickly on a diamond lead and club shift, or slowly
on a more passive defense. 3NT had better play even though it
was still far from cold. The best defense, a club lead followed
by the H8 shift, would hold Beatty to seven tricks while a heart
lead would give Sutherlin his eighth trick immediately, and a
chance for a ninth, if he guessed to look for it in diamonds.

{
2C showed a minor one-suiter or a major and minor two-suiter.
2D asked and 2H showed hearts and a minor. Ellasue's pass of
2H seems rather conservative, unless Martin is in the habit of
often taking this same action with a much poorer hand (certainly
possible when non-vulnerable, as he was).

{
This might have been a good time (at favorable vulnerability)
for Sutherlin to "psych" a 1S response on subminimum values,
provided he could have kept Beatty from driving to game, since
double dummy plus 140 is possible. But E/W had a free run in
the auction and bought the contract for 2D. With only four top
losers (two hearts, one spade and one trump) Gawrys had a chance
for plus 110.

[Declarer "N"]
{
Gawrys' weak jump overcall gave his opponents a problem; they
didn't manage to solve it. Beatty was much too strong for a direct
heart raise, so over 3H he cue-bid 3S, got a diamond preference
and followed up with 4S. Personally, I think Sutherlin was worth
6D then. Instead he  cue-bid the CA, and when Beatty finally
showed his heart support, Sutherlin passed fearing two minor
suit losers. Making six: plus 680.
