{
East opened a 15 HCP (a three-ace, three-and-a-half Honor Trick
hand with a decent five-card suit can't be counted as less---DK)
1NT. Despite his wealth of high cards, West used Stayman because
there might well be an extra ruffing trick in a four-four spade
fit. South led the HJ, an ambiguous card that could be top, but
could also be from an internal sequence plus the HK, since Zia
and Hamman disdain the popular "Jack Denies" lead convention.

{
With a square hand, weak three-card spade support, and strength
concentrated in the other three-card suits, South judged reasonably
to respond 1NT rather than raise spades. North's decision to
bid game in notrump rather than in spades might have turned out
well if the only issue were "Do we have game?" for nine tricks
in notrump (South must supply only one) look easier than ten
in spades (South must supply two). Hamman's 3NT was descriptive,
showing long solid spades, so it was open to Zia to correct to
4S, even with poor support. It's easy to see why Zia passed

{
At matchpoints, I would have thought a 3C opening would have
some appeal. Zia passed, however, because he had a wonderful
dummy for both majors, a surprise ace, and a hand that Hamman
would not expect. Hamman's third-seat 1H was in keeping with
their overall approach, but Zia supported hearts once too often,
and Weisman told him so[DC]. There is some rational for pulling
to 4C when the opponents double a partscore unexpectedly.

Donna Compton probably wished she was playing blackjack with
the West cards, and chose to pass the marginal hand. This allowed
N/S a simple natural auction to a nice secure partscore. Some
West players may enter the auction on the second round with a
double to show the pointed suits - revolting as they are.

{
Robinson started with a strong NT (15-17) and Boyd, with 8 HCP
and two tens passed. At teams this would not be his choice. At
pairs however, it rates to be the winner in the long run. A top
pair wants to get their matchpoints by outplaying the field,
not by bidding ulta thin games (at least in the qualifing stages).
On this hand, bidding was the winner as every card was perfect
for E/W.

Zia, looking at 20 HCP and a semi-balanced hand, opened 1S. Had
his suits been minors, he would have been tempted to start with
2NT. Here however, 1S is best. Hamman's pass was very conservative,
and again at IMPs he would take a bid.

{
N/S had a free ride to the top spot. 2H was a transfer to spades
and Hamman bid only two. The followers of "The Law" insist that
North super-accept with four spades, but his soft cards in the
minors held him back. The vulnerability kept E/W out of the bidding
and Hamman no doubt took that into consideration (it would be
very difficult for E/W to balance vulnerable over 2S).

{
Balancing against a spade is different than balancing against
a club. The HCP range is much wider as you don't have room to
double and rebid NT at a comfortable level. As a result, with
some fifteen or sixteen point hands you will balance with 1NT
rather than double and be forced into a 2NT rebid.

East's 2D response to 1S over North's slightly off-shape takeout
double was undoubtedly the increasingly popular "Two-Way Constructive
Raise" (2C showing three trumps, 2D showing four). That explains
West's direct jump to 4S over South's 2H with his high-card minimum
6=1=2=4 hand

{
When South made a negative double of East's weak jump overcall,
North followed "Hamman's Law," which says that if 3NT is one
of your options, bid it. West took advantage of the "favorable"
vulnerability to save in 4H, but thoughtfully bid 4C on the way
to suggest a lead if N/S bid 4S, running to 4H of course when
doubled. When 4H came around to South, he invented "Zia's Codicil"
to Hamman's Law, which says that if 4NT is one of your options
after you were willing to play in 3NT, bid it.

East's 2D was some version of the "Multi" - very popular in Europe,
but seldom seen in the USA - usually showing a hand that would
be opened a weak 2H or 2S. Here it was based on a weak 2S hand,
but unlike a weak 2S bid, 2D let South enter with 2H. West's
double showed hearts, but was not, strictly speaking, a penalty
double.

Fredin stayed silent on the first round of bidding with his gigantic
red two-suiter, but couldn't contain himself when the opponents
reached the spade game. Was it really necessary to save unilaterally
in diamonds? [DC] There also was a strong likelyhood of four
spades in partner's hand on the auction. A 4NT bid would be construed
as any two-suiter (except spades, of course).

Moss, obviously from a light school of preempting, chose to open
1S. Zia, always on the lookout for the esoteric, overcalled 1NT.
He had the right point-count, but his distribution was a little
out of kilter. Hamman came alive with his 6-5, and transferred
to hearts. Moss re-emphasized his spades, and Zia rebid 2NT.
This was undiscussed, but had overtones of a source of tricks,
and Hamman raised to 3NT.
