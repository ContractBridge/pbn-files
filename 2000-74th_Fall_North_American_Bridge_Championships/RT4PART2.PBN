{
North's diamond response to South's strong club was negative.
South's double of East's heart overcall  was take out.  When
north bid a free two spades, South knew despite her good hand
that game would have good play, but slam would be a poor bet.
And so it was. The lead of the heart king made the play easy
but with the spade king singleton on side and the club queen
under the ace, all roads lead to twelve tricks and plus 480 for
N/S.

{
West's weak NT was raised to 3NT. North led the H7 showing some
length but no serious interest in the suit. South, upon winning
the club, had the spot light. N/S play smith echo, a defensive
carding method in which the play at trick two gives attitude
towards the opening lead. Since the lead of the seven had announced
the attitude at trick one, should not the spot played at trick
two be suit preference? I think so! [JG]

{
A simple auction to the best spot. Since North's diamond could
have been short, West led the DJ. When East was in with the DQ,
he had to switch to a heart or it would be lost! West would be
squeezed out of the HK and jack fourth of spades. On the club
return and duck, South would have to come to her hand to play
another club that West would have to duck again to have any chance.
If he wins the club and returns anything but a heart, (in which
case she plays the queen) declarer runs diamonds, cashes her
club, and West is squeezed in hearts and spades.

{
Because South's "Precision" 1D was nebulous, North was in no
position to raise diamonds over West's intervening double. South
showed long diamonds with her 2D rebid over North's 1NT, and
West, with a fine hand, made a repeat takeout double. Over North's
belated diamond raise, East bid his 6-card spade suit, and West,
reading East for long spades (not many high cards left for East
on the auction), raised to 4S. On the auction, South's singleton
club lead was normal enough.

{
West had neither a suit good enough to overcall nor shape enough
for a takeout double of South's nebulous Precision 1D. North,
with a distributional hand, a singleton spade, and little defense,
had reason to be afraid that East would enter successfully in
spades, and might have risked a 3H preempt if available in her
partnership. [DK] Her actual 1H let East enter with 2S, a weak
jump overcall, just about right on values when vul between two
bidders.

{
West passed a hand most would open nowadays, then doubled South's
14-16 1NT: unspecified 4-card major and longer minor. North's
2H was natural; South bid spades, and somehow the partnership
ended in game. North "justified" the strange route to game by
making it. Winning the diamond lead in hand, she lost a finesse
to West's SJ. West continued diamonds, and covered dummy's SQ
with the SK. East dropped a helpful S9. A deep heart finesse
lost to West's HJ, and a third diamond tapped dummy as East discarded
a spade.

{
Greco's multi 2D (weak two in either major) made it difficult
for N/S. East bid two hearts asking West to pass or correct to
2S if that was his suit. The pass of two diamonds doubled would
have shown diamonds and suggested that as a possible resting
spot. Wei-Sender made a free bid of three diamonds but Chambers,
with a dead minimum passed.

{
Hampson rebid his hearts rather than show his poor diamond suit
over Greco's negative double. Then after West's 2NT rebid, he
cue-bid showing a good hand. West ended the bidding with 3NT.
Greco played the hand well. He handled the diamonds well by crossing
to a heart and playing South for a singleton, thus picking up
the suit for one loser.

{
Chamber's intermediate 2S bid ended the auction. Hampson started
well with the king and queen of diamonds, but the third round
of the suit cost an overtrick. North was able to score five spades
and four hearts when the club shift would have held declarer
to eight tricks. Hampson was playing partner for a heart honour,
and had no way of knowing that the club shift was necessary.

{
E/W have a combined 28 HCP and no fit, so most tables will reach
3NT. Every line leads to at least nine tricks, so the points
on the deal will be decided by overtricks. Clearly, with K-x-x
spades onside, declarer can score eleven tricks simply by winning
the diamond lead, crossing to hand, playing on spades, and subsequently
leading a heart to the queen. So, which black suit should declarer
attack?

The two-two diamond break seems to give E/W nine tricks in notrump,
but the diamond blockage and the lack of an entry to the East
hand reduced that number to eight. At our featured table, North
allowed declarer to score a ninth trick by ducking the second
round of hearts.

{
4S is well against the odds after North's opening bid. Clubs
were three-three, but with the spade king offside, declarer still
had four top losers after the expected diamond opening lead.
No one can argue with E/W's first three bids, so perhaps West's
leap to game is just a bit too much. NS plus 50 is likely to
win the board and should gain at least a tie.(MS)
