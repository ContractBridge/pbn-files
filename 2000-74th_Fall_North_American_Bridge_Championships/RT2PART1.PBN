{
Bates' decision to open a "modern" mix-them-up weak two-bid in
third seat worked badly. It kept his side out of a heart contract
and pushed E/W into 3NT. Bates has no doubt had good success
with this type of action, and if the gun backfires once in a
while, so be it. When East balanced with three clubs, West knew
one thing ... he had spades stopped!He bid a hopeful 3NT, and
was rewarded when North led from strength rather than weakness.

{
The auction started with 1D (unbalanced or 18-19 HCP balanced).
3D over the natural 2H confirmed an unbalanced hand and a non-minimum.
3H ostensibly asked East for a heart guard, and 3S showed something
in spades. 3NT showed a willingness to play in notrump if East
had a partial heart stopper (East had denied a full stopper when
he bid 3S over 3H).

{
Even in a large pairs field, one would expect this deal to be
fairly flat. In the Reisinger, I would expect ten tricks at notrump
to produce a tie in most matches. N/S have an easy game in diamonds
and notrump, but at this form of scoring plus 400 in diamonds
would be a disaster. Bates/Smith avoided that trap easily enough.

[Contract "1NT"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
As N/S can take nine or ten tricks in hearts and E/W nine in
spades or diamonds, the outcome of the deal will often depend
on whether East's strong notrump preempts one side or the other
out of a profitable suit contract. After 1NT, some Souths may
venture a conventional overcall (2C to show a four-card major
and longer clubs would be best) but now E/W may back into spades.
If East buys the contract in 1NT, as here, the defense must avoid
giving declarer the lead early. That means staying off the attractive
club lead, a difficult assignment. Bates managed that beautifully,
starting with the H3

{
Duboin rejected both 1NT (my choice: [JG]) and 2D over Bates'
1S and it's easy to see why (moderate values, vulnerabilty, and
no spot card higher than a five call for caution). Bates might
have simply jumped to game as a two-way shot, but did even better
by making a help suit game of 3D, rejected by Smith. South could
have been held to nine tricks on a diamond lead but was now cold
for ten (with the spade onside and the diamonds blocked).

{
After a straightforward auction, North declared 4S. East's diamond
lead gave nothing away. After drawing two rounds of trumps, Smith
took the heart finesse, which lost. The defenders cashed their
club trick, and when diamonds didn't break, declarer had only
ten tricks. Plus 420 for N/S

[Declarer "N"]
{
South's 4C call showed four hearts, short clubs, and a hand good
enough to play in game. The only flaw was that his singleton
club was the ace but I like the bid [JG]. Now the focus was on
Smith, who had enough for a mild slam try. Some partnerships
play an interesting treatment in cases like this: Last Train.
This treatment, invented by Meckwell, defines the remaining below-game
step as an expression of mild non-specific slam interest.

{
Both pairs did very well here. N/S bid a thin but worthwhile
4H and E/W took the save in their best suit. With the HK onside
doubleton and the DA right, Smith was going to have no trouble
making his contract; he would have lost only one diamond and
two clubs. The defense agaist 5D doubled was best. N/S began
by taking the first five tricks and forcing Fallenius to guess
diamonds. He went right by playing the ace and dropping Smith's
now blank king.

East had an easy double of Smith's 1D opening. West, with long

the partnership to the three-level), but also catering to an
East hand with four small spades and nothing else. The defense
took the first three tricks, but North could never get South
in to get a club ruff.

{
East's system required him to rebid spades over the game-forcing
2C rather than raise clubs directly. His 4D thereafter showed
short diamonds and at least fair club support. Sutherlin went
Blackwooding. East showed one key card with 5D and the CQ and
the SK with 5S. West knew that 7C would be virtually cold but
went for the home run. A swing and a miss! East's spades were
spotty, and even with the finesse of the queen right, the suit
did not run.

[Contract "5C"]
[Declarer "W"]
{
North's distributional preemptive raise to 4S gave East a problem
that no one could solve with any confidence. East had no way
to know that West had enough high cards (including a spade trick)
to beat 4S. Under the circumstances, East's solution - bidding
5C - would probably be the popular choice. North led his singleton
diamond against 5C, and struck gold in the form of South's three
top diamond tricks. North's first discard, the S7, was an "odd-even"
signal encouraging in spades.

{
North's "DONT" 2D, showing diamonds and an unspecified major,
set an unlikely problem for East, who knew the strength was evenly
divided. Suppose North's major is spades. East's 2H will get
N/S to 2S (South will "know" which major North has), but a pass
leaves North to play 2D. So, East should pass and defend against
2D rather than 2S. Suppose North's major is hearts. Then East
should surely prefer to defend hearts than declare hearts.
