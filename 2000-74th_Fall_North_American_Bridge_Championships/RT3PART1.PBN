{
At our featured table, East led a diamond, giving declarer a
third trick in that suit, and thereafter he kept exiting in diamonds
every time he gained the lead. However, declarer had nine tricks
via three in each minor, two hearts and one spade. A low spade
lead is the best start for the defence (or a heart). Declarer
can win, and play a club to the queen, but must be careful not
to continue with the CJ. East would win, and play a heart (or
cash the SA first).

Declarer, Lair, staved off immediate defeat through a spade ruff

were lying, Lair played on cross-ruff lines to go only one down.

{
West's courageous trump lead was an effort to stop diamond ruffs
in dummy, which the aution had suggested. Actually, next to costing
a trump trick as such, the lead cost heavily when declarer, Lair,
did not need a diamond ruff, but the defense did! Lair simply
knocked out the CA, pulled the remaining trumps, and claimed
eleven tricks. After an initial diamond lead, declarer would
have gone down, suffering a diamond (over)ruff by East.

DK. The DA lead actually gave the contract away as declarer can't

{
4H by EW is a fair game that essentially needs one of the pointed-suit
aces onside and no terrible breaks. Today both aces were in the
North hand, so most tables will score EW plus 650. East at our
featured table put his side's game bonus on the line by passing
the solid balanced 12-count in first seat. West opened his good
five-card major and East showed a sound raise to at least 3H
over North's takeout double. West did not feel he could bid game
facing a passed hand, so he declined the invitation with 3H,
and East gave up.

{
With 4-3-3-3, only 9 HCP, and no wealth of intermediates (after
all, he's only one nine spot above average), Mouser's 3NT was
a little aggressive. On a diamond lead, Rothwarf has to guess
well to make his game. He must decide: should he hope diamonds
are four-four with the CJ onside, or should he win the opening
lead in dummy and go after spades, hoping for seven tricks in
the majors? Not an easy choice. But Rothwarf wasn't tested when
Lair led a low spade. Since spades were bid on his right, Lair
should have known it probably was a bad lead.

If you raise you partner's one of a major overcall to game, he
will expect many trumps, some distribution, and not many high-card
points. Most players wouldn't jump to 4S with this West hand.
East did have great playing strength and Rothwarf may have thought
about making a slam move anyway. In the end he passed his partner's
preempt, and the great slam was missed.

{
Goldfein has a very powerful hand and doesn't need much from
Lair to make 5H. Yet, his choice of bidding 5H seems a little
odd. What's wrong with a double? Even at this high level a double
should say: shortness in their suit, willingness to bid on, and
extra values. It's not clear what Lair would have done over a
double.

{
Lair upgraded an average 19-count to 2NT and, after a stayman
sequence, finished in 4H. It would have been normal for East,
knowing N/S are in a four-four fit, to lead a trump.  The lead
of the singleton DQ may waste an important card. Wolpert thought
otherwise and led the DQ. Feldman ducked the Q, expecting Lair
to have only four diamonds for his 2NT opener. But the damage
was already done: making four.

{
4S was not a good contract, with the HA not carrying full weight.
Lair, declarer as South, planned to set up the clubs, duck a
round of trumps, cash the SA next, and discard dummy's losing
diamonds on his good clubs. The defense would be welcome to its
second spade trick anytime, but declarer would get to ruff his
losing diamond. The club finesse lost, but all was well when
the third round of clubs could be ruffed only by the defender
having the long trumps (including a natural trump trick).

As E/W could make 3C, bidding 3H was right, provided it would
not be doubled and go only one down. The defense had a chance
to set the contract two, but only if they had gone after the
spade ruff soon enough, when West still had an entry. After trick
2 it would have been too late, assuming declarer, Goldfein, would
play diamonds to sever E/W communication before tackling trumps.

{
East, unfortunately, managed to preempt his side out of 4S. From
West's point of view, East was far more likely to hold short
spades than short clubs. At IMPs, he probably should try 3S,
but at board-a-match, the decision is more delicate, and his
pass was very reasonable. The play involved another board-a-match
decision for declarer: whether or not to finesse in hearts. The
finesse happened to be the losing line as declarer incurred a
spade ruff.

{
Rarely you can make 3NT when an opponent has a strong notrump
opening, but it is the case here. Whichever major the defenders
attack against 3NT, declarer simply plays a club towards the
queen. He cannot be stopped from making four clubs, two diamonds,
two spades and a ninth trick in one of the majors. Whether the
Italians were going to bid game in an uncontested auction is
doubtful, and South's marginal 1NT overcall made it virtually
certain that they would not. Versace doubled the 1NT overcall
and North redoubled, showing an undefined single-suited and forcing
South to bid 2C.

{
It is hard to tell who got the good result here, although the
odds must favor the Italians. The Italians played in the wrong
suit for this form of scoring, particularly with 2S being a favorite
to make. In 2D, Versace had to guess the trumps in the endgame
and when he got them wrong he was one down; N/S plus 50. The
defenders could have made things tougher for declarer though,
by putting him to a first-round heart guess that he would probably
have gotten wrong.
