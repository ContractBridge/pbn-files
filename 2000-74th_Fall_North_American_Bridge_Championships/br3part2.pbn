[Contract "3NT"]
[Declarer "W"]
{
3NT is a fine contract, with ten tricks available on the normal
spade lead. Declarer won and tried the club finesse. When that
won, he had only to knock out the HA to end up with five diamonds,
two clubs, two spades and a heart for a fairly normal result.
If North does not overcall 1S, East might declare 3NT on a club
lead and come to an eleventh winner. Plus 430 and an average
board.

{
3NT looks hopeless on the lie of the cards, but wait. On the
normal heart lead, West wins and shifts to a spade. Declarer
wins in dummy and plays a club to the jack. West wins and returns
a second spade to declarer's ace. When the clubs fail to split,
declarer cashes the DA and exits with the fourth club to endplay
East. If he plays ace and a heart, West will be squeezed in the
pointed suits on dummy's last club. So East must exit with a
low heart without cashing the ace.

[Contract "4H"]
[Declarer "W"]
{
Both East and West had difficult decisions in the bidding. West
could have justified a retreat to 3C but when he boldly introduced
hearts, East, with a fourth trump, was delighted. The diamond
lead was awkward for declarer. Melander tried to maintain control
by ducking a round of trumps after ruffing the opening lead.
Best defense would have been for Kiefer to play a second diamond,
after which declarer would do best to discard a spade from dummy,
ruff the third diamond, cash the HA, and play CA (jack), club.
If South discards (best), declarer wins the C10 and concedes
a trump.

[Contract "4S"]
[Declarer "N"]
{
This board was not a success for our N/S friends, although they
will, no doubt, have lots of company. The main question is how
many Easts are going to double on the off chance that the side
suits will provide two defensive tricks. This East may have kicked
himself when three club tricks cashed. Notice that 4S will always
go down on a club lead (unless the clubs block), even if the
spades had split 2-2, for a fourth round of clubs would promote
a defensive trump trick.

[Contract "3H"]
[Declarer "N"]
{
The combination of South's SJ, DK, and the HQ being onside is
enough to make 4H cold. Declarer simply uses the DK to take the
heart finesse and loses one trick in each side suit. But although
Krekorian-Kiefer got close, they could not reach game. The trump
lead took the guess out of that suit and Krekorian drew trumps
and turned his attention to the side suits. If he played the
CQ, ruffed the club return, and then played the SQ (assuming
that the SK is offside based on the double) Levitina would have
to win and cash the DA before declarer's diamonds went away on
the spades.

[Contract "4S"]
[Declarer "S"]
{
The play in 4S is not straightforward. For example, two hearts
can be pitched on the DAK but declarer must decide how to handle
clubs. If they're three-three or the jack falls doubleton he
can simply ignore them and play on trumps, losing only a heart
and one or two trumps. But if the CJ is fourth, as on the actual
deal, the S10 may score when he tries to ruff a club, even when
trumps are three-two. Declarer would like to draw two rounds
of trumps first, but that might allow the defense to play a third
trump before he can ruff a club.

[Declarer "E"]
{
It's possible for N/S to make 4H (except on  a trump lead or
a diamond lead and trump shift), but it's easy to see why East
bought the contract for 3S. In fact, 4S is cold on any lead and
will make five if the defenders don't cash their clubs either
immediately or when they get in with the HA. The diamond lead
gave Robson a chance to play for an extra overtrick, but he had
to decide how to go about it.

{
N/S thought they could compete safely to 3S and they were right,
as nine tricks are available on any lead (with East holding the
doubleton diamond honor). What they failed to realize, however,
was that a double would have landed them a cool plus 300 as six
tricks are available against 3H. Oh well, some days are like
that. The defense was accurate and Krekorian-Kiefer ended with
their expected nine tricks; plus 140 for a surprisingly excellent
result.

[Declarer "N"]
{
When Krekorian treated his 6-3-2-2 hand as balanced and opened
1NT, game was quickly reached. We've all seen better contracts,
but 3NT is the game that most often makes when it shouldn't -
as here. If Lyon leads a diamond, the defense gets five tricks
when Kuhnle plays three rounds from the top. And Maybe Lyon should
have found it: his spade length hinted that South's four-card
major was hearts.

[Declarer "E"]
{
E/W bid sensibly to 3NT, and the normal expectation is that there
will be nine top tricks, with a chance for eleven if the spades
break three-three. That is certainly why declarer, East, did
not avail himself of the opportunity to possibly establish a
second club stopper (though not a trick) by inserting the C7
on the second round.
