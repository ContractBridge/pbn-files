{
Versace, who could make 3D all by himself, correctly judged that
his partner Lauria had a bust. He knew he was likely to go down
in 4D. 3H can be set with a spade ruff and a diamond ruff, so
his 'sacrifice' may hurt more at board-a-match than at imps.

{
There are two schools of thought on what to do with the West
hand after a 1D-opening. Some will double, while others will
overcall the five-card major, planning to offer the remaining
two suits later in the auction. Foster chose to double. Following
North's preemptive raise, East must have given some thought to
doubling, but bid the NT game instead. An interesing defensive
signaling situation cropped up. When a spade trick was lost to
North's king at trick 4, South discarded the DK!

{
 It is not often that  you will see two world champions play
in a partial when they can make a game. To be fair, however,
it wouldn't have been too surprising to see this deal passed
out. When Lauria opened the bidding in third seat, his side at
least had assured a plus score. The North-South cards fit perfectly,
so both 4S and 5D were excellent contracts.

{
Stewart's negative free bid of 2S looks a little too strong for
the hand. Stewart probably disagrees, but the important thing
is what Woolsey thought. When he didn't move over 2S, the cold
game was missed. Lauria won the club lead, shifted to diamonds,
and jumped up with the SA. If Versace had the SK and declarer
a third diamond, a diamond ruff was possible. Versace returned
a diamond.

{
Goldenberg's overcall stopped N/S from finding their four-four
heart fit, but since they would have taken at most six tricks
in hearts, they didn't mind. With the CQ favorably placed, Obuko
was never in danger of going down in 1NT, and even if the defenders
did as well as they could, it all ended with an overtrick. Two
made: minus 120.

[Declarer "E"]
{
Lauria didn't want to let his opponents play 2H, so he raised
to 2S on his king doubleton, expecting his three prime cards
to compensate for the missing trump. 2S is an interesting contract,
and on a heart lead it looks like one down, but the defenders
have to be careful, and one tiny mistake may be enough to see
declarer home. When Obuko took the push to 3H on his terrible
hand, the 2S bid had succeeded in its mission, and 3H had no
play after a spade to the king and a spade back.

{
 Lauria's 1S bid was nonforing and less than 9 HCP; Versace could
have bid 2H but elected to emphasize his good diamond suit in
an auction where the hearts rated to be on his left. There was
good news and bad news for the Italians. By not mentioning hearts,
Sukoneck unsuspectingly led the suit, giving Versace a chance
to hold his losers to three. The bad news was that he failed
to draw trumps before playing a second heart.

{
Versace's heart lead was normal, but ace and a spade would have
cooked Beatty's goose quite nicely, holding him to seven tricks.
On the heart lead, however, Beatty had the timing to set up his
diamonds and make his game. But that was not the full story of
the deal. When Lauria came in with the DK he found the good C9
shift. Beatty finessed the queen losing to Versace's king but
when Versace continued with the CJ Lauria's deuce was consistent
with an original holding of 9852.

{
Versace's 3NT appears to have no play on a spade lead, but such
is the nature of illusion. When Versace cashed six rounds of
diamonds, Treber came under unbearable pressure. He had to discard
both of his spade winners and in the three-card ending, was endplayed
with the CA to yield to South two heart tricks for his contract.
Woolf's club shift at trick two did not make a difference.

{
 Lauria-Versace used an interesting gadget to reach 4H. When
South made a game try by bidding 3H, Lauria bid 3NT to indicate
very good hearts. A partnership adopting this approach should
discuss how to handle auctions in which notrump may still be
the strain of the final contract.

{
North's leap to 3NT is a very interesting bid. One consideration
must have been that South would not have opened a very minimal
hand with short spades. The second one was that an auction like
this would help declarer place the missing high cards. In that
respect, he would be fooled, however: East had more HCP than
West. But the main reason for North's bid was simply his six
card club support. Unluckily for N/S, East found the only lead
to beat the contact when he put a heart on the table.

 West's preference for spades is common practice when 1NT is

No, North did not missort his hand; his 2D-bid was a transfer

makes. The defense against 3NT was disasterous. E/W started out
well with a spade lead and continuation, but at trick three,
West returned the wrong black queen.

and hearts. North bid 3C, at least invitational with diamond
support. None of this deterred Tony Forrester, East, for many
rounds to come with his massive support for both of Helgemo's
suits. Versace used RKCB, and upon hearing one keycard, bid the
6D slam over Forrester's 5H bid. Forrester, who took an excellent
save yesterday, believed the opponents, and took the sacrifice
in 6H, which was doubled by Versace.

{
3NT is cold on the N/S cards. On the expected diamond lead declarer
can give up a diamond to score four diamonds, three clubs and
two hearts while the defense can come to only three spades and
a diamond. On any other lead declarer simply plays a low diamond
to the ten. If East ducks, declarer uses his club entries to
force four diamond tricks. But here the Italians chose to go
for the gusto in 1D doubled.
