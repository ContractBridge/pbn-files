{
After a natural start, with 2C showing five or more clubs and
10-15 HCP, Eliazohn's 3D showed extra values with four or more
diamonds. Melander had no wish to play a minor suit contract,
yet his 3NT bid looks wrong. Eliazohn wouldn't have bid 3D with
2-2-4-5, so he had to have a shortness, and if it was in spades,
notrump would often be wrong.

{
Beatty transferred to 2H, then offered a choice of games with
3NT. Since his bidding sequence only catered to hearts and notrumps,
I think a better choice would have been 3D. It is true that his
diamonds are weak, but with an unbalanced hand and the possibility
of playing in spades - a four-three or five-three fit - 3D simply
has to be better than the bulky 3NT.

{
If you have a special opening bid for minimum hands with five
hearts and four spades, there is no point responding 1S on the
North hand. Even if you don't have a special bid, 1NT still looks
better than 1S. Over Beatty's 2C rebid, Sutherlin's 2NT was too
optimistic at matchpoints. A simple raise to 3C would have been
enough. When Beatty raised 2NT to the poor game, it looked like
he expected quite a bit more from his partner.

With 8 HCP, 5-3-3-2 distribution and one doubleton queen, looking
for game opposite a 15-17 1NT opening is too aggressive at matchpoints.
The end result was Jim Kirkham having to declare a shaky 3-level
contract instead of a comfortable 2H. Beatty led the DA and shifted

East's 3H-rebid was a splinter in support of clubs. It is not

to play in notrump in case West was well-heeled in hearts. The
club lead could have given away a trick as it prevented declarer
from giving up a diamond before pulling trump.

West did not bother to check for a 5-3 heart fit because of his
relatively balanced hand, and simply raised to 3NT. This had
the advantage that East's spades were not mentioned. If they
had been bid, Beatty, South, might have reconsidered his opening
lead. Declarer cashed three spades, and Sutherlin, North, was
under pressure and let go his fourth club.

{
Beatty opened 1NT and Sutherlin, North, transferred to hearts
and rebid his second suit, diamonds. When South could not oblige
with adequate support for either, North simply bid 6NT on power.
The club finesse on opening lead succeeded, and declarer could
now afford to take the heart finesse. He was probably relieved
when it lost, for this meant that pairs in a grand slam would
go down. 6NT made six: plus 1440.

Although East thought his spades were good enough to bid, he
did not think they were good enough to lead.  Against 3NT he
led a top heart. It certainly was the right thing to do, when
the defense ran the first five tricks! In the auction, South
knew that his partnership held  substantial values in spades,
increasing the likelyhood of a leak elsewhere.

{
Nowadays, many players think they have a duty to go to the 3-level
voluntarily as soon as they have found a nine-card fit. Sutherlin
isn't one of them. He looked at his cards, saw only minor honors
and raised to 2S. That gave Barrow a chance to slip in a 2NT
bid, and Beatty took a rosy view of his hand and invited game
with 3H. This was turned down by Sutherlin (still looking at
only minor honors).

{
4S on North-South requires three-two breaks in both spades and
hearts. Since West's negative double told his opponents that
hearts were four-one or five-zero, a part-score would be enough
this time. It looks like Sutherlin's redouble gave away a tempo,
and maybe it would have been better to show the spade support
immediately.

E/W had a big heart fit and enough values for game, so Sutherlin's
light third seat opening didn't hurt his opponents. 4H needed
the DA onside, but if Beatty had the CA and lead a spade from
at least one honor, the position of the DA would become irrelevant.
Sibert lost the obvious three tricks. Just made: plus 420. Incidentally,
4S would have been a correct save, but how do you find it?

When Hand showed 12-14 HCP and four spades, Siebert was a little
timid,  raisiing to 3S only. Five trumps and a void is a great
holding! She had only six losers, suggesting that game would
be on more often than not. Here, it didn't matter because Hand
accepted the invitation. He won the club lead with the ace and
claimed ten tricks when all followed to the SQ ("draw trumps,
knock out HA and HK"): minus 420 for N/S.

South was relieved when he did not have to bid anymore. He could

North's choice of opening bid may have been systemic, but could
also have been inspired by the Hideous Hog's "weaker minor, partner?"
philosophy. The contract would have been cold after a spade lead,
but East found the heart lead that should have led to declarer's
defeat. West needed to shift the SJ, but was too fixated on hearts.
When West won the HT, she returned a heart missing the relevance
of her partner's HQ.
