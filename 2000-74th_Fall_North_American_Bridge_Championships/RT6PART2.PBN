{
In general, a combined 22 HCP and an 8-card fit will not produce
game. This hand is no exception, although it needs a losing club
finesse and a four-one trump break to defeat 4S. Having said
that, neither of those is particularly unlikely once North has
opened with a weak two-bid. Boyd's obstructive raise to 3H robbed
West of his cue-bid, and instead he chose a fairly conservative
simple raise to 3S.

{
This board's fate depends on the opening lead. East had to choose
between the red suits. Either could be right, and will be some
of the time. After 1NT-Pass-3NT, the odds favor leading a major,
and a heart lead would be the choice of a majority of experts.
On this deal, a heart lead gives declarer a guess if E/W can
disguise the heart length. The winning line is to simply set
up a spade for the ninth trick. If declarer thinks hearts are
five-three, though, he may instead take the diamond finesse.

{
North took one more bid than his hand was worth, so it is no
surprise that 3NT is a terrible contract. Here, Boyd needed the
five clubs and the diamond finesse, into the bidder. Although
the Boyd/Robinson style is 'sound openings', bidding on over
3C on that North hand seems more likely to turn a plus into a
minus. Add the CQ to the South hand, and game is still against
the odds.

Boyd's 2S rebid after the forcing notrump showed a six-card suit.
Robinson bid what he knew to be a good game. The defense gave
declarer no chance by leading diamonds and switching to hearts.
When both black kings were offside, down one was the result.
If hearts are not played early enough, the heart loser goes on
the clubs. N/S minus 50.

{
Had E/W they pressed on, they would have been doubled. 4H is
down off the top (with a diamond ruff) and 4D will take great
guessing and still likely fail. South won the diamond lead and
played a club to the queen. When it won, he tested spades - they
were friendly - and he was almost home. He ruffed the diamond
continuation and drew the last trump with dummy's jack.

Weichsel invited and Sontag was charmed to accept. It is likely
that East's direct 3S showed a five-card suit, as he could have
bid 2NT, lebenshol, and after the forced 3C response, invited
with 3S to show a four-card suit. The play was simple - E/W lost
the three aces.

{
East's Polish 1C opening was artificial, forcing one round and
usually based on a balanced 12-14 HCP. West's 1NT response was
natural, showing a balanced 7-10 HCP without a 4-card major.
North's normal H3 lead went to South's HA, and two more rounds
of hearts cleared the suit, setting up North's H10. A diamond
finesse lost to South's DK, and South's SJ return went to dummy's
SK. Declarer played on clubs---necessary before running diamonds,
to avoid squeezing himself---and when dummy's CK held, he finessed
the C10.

{
E/W reached the good 4H game via a 1NT response and a promotion
of East's hand to game strength when West bid hearts in reply.
Note North's sensible pass, vulnerable, with a decent hand containing
two aces but no stuffing in his 6-card suit. North's good low-club
lead let South score the CK, and South's good low-diamond shift
scored North's DA before declarer could set up a discard for
either minor-suit loser. When the HQ fell on the first round,
West could claim ten tricks.

{
E/W play a two-over-one response as game-forcing unless responder
rebids his suit. Since West could pass a 3C rebid, East rebid
a forcing 2NT. A skinny six-card suit like West's heart suit
does not lend itself well to notrump play, for it cannot be established
quickly. West did well to bid 3H rather than raise to 3NT at
his third turn. In 4H, West was able to ruff his third diamond
in dummy losing only the SA and two trump tricks.

[Declarer "N"]
{
N/S had a strange-looking auction to 4H. 2S showed a heart fit
and limit-plus values, and 4C was a slam try, showing shortness.
4D appears to be "Last Train," a nondescript "too good to sign
off" mechanism, but that looks like an overstatement. 4H was
the normal contract, however. On a spade lead, declarer must
cash the top clubs to dispose of his spade loser, thus denuding
dummy of fast entries. He would have to guess whether to play
a heart or a diamond (best) from dummy.The actual club lead allowed
declarer to retain the SA as a later entry, so he was able to
play a trump first.

{
Boyd was flying on his own here, facing an unpassed partner.
All he needed from North was two aces and a little length in
one of his suits for a slam to be very good. This time, Boyd
bought a useless dummy. Trumps divided three-three, but the defense
was deadly accurate and the contract went down two: N/S minus
200.

A tricky BAM deal to finish the session. Boyd/Robinson achieved
a decent result by playing 3D, taking nine tricks; NS plus 110.
Had E/W competed to 3S, them maximum for N/S would have been
plus 100 (by doubling and taking two diamonds and three hearts).
N/S could also have done better by eschewing the nine-card diamond
fit to play in 3H on their four-three fit.
