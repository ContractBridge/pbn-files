{
West, with exciting distribution, was able to enter on little
high-card strength over South's 1H response. North cue-bid 3C
to show a high-card raise to 4H. That kept the bidding low enough
for East to raise to 4C with little risk, enabling West to find
a cheap phantom save. North doubled 5C, quite properly, but South
- who was also balanced, and without extra length in hearts -
unaccountably [DK] pulled to the no-play 5H.

South ruined East's plan of showing both minors by opening 1C,
his six-card club suit. Here 2NT would show hearts and diamonds
so he bid 1D, hoping for the best. At his next chance, after
N/S found their spade fit, he showed his true color(s) with a
natural 3C bid. South, despite his devalued CK, competed to 3S
on the strength of his strong trumps.

Levin opened in third chair, and passed partner's response. His
fourth spade was certainly a good reason to bid, but his square
shape convinced him to pass. Despite the vulnerability, East
balanced with a double. West might have tried 1NT, but chose
his only four-card suit. Levin pressed on with 2S, and now that
he had allowed them to push him a level higher, he was able to
play there.

{
North's 2D opening bid was as "Flannery," describing a limited
opening bid with four spades and five hearts, Although its supporters
swear by it, very few expert partnerships use it. It makes this
awkward hand pattern easy to describe, and a number of top pairs
use it. Here it got N/S to the four-four spade fit, but with
little in the way of high card points, foul distribution and
accurate defense it had to go down two. Hamman in balancing seat,
must have been thinking about the '92 Olympiad final. Against
a similar auction, the French pair doubled Wolff, Hamman's partner,
in the balancing seat and collected 1100.

Zia is from the school where preempts may (and in fact should)
contain some surprises. Here he had quit a few. When Levin's
3D overcall came back to him, he doubled! Hamman had a difficult
choice. classic shape - 6313, perhaps 6304 - and did not fancy
his chances playing the hand in clubs or hearts on a likely trump
lead. Zia's fourth made a big difference to Hamman's evaluation,
however, and his decision to defend worked badly. Levin bought
an enormous dummy and the defense could not stop nine tricks
(with one heart ruff). Plus 470

{
East/West used a checkback sequence to locate their four-four
spade fit and played there from the strong side. Although the
bidding revealed that East was at least four-four in the majors,
it didn't make Levin's lead any easier. He feared that a that
a diamond lead into opener's first bid suit would set up pitches
for dummy's clubs, so he led the CA. Had he led a diamond, declarer
could play all out, and ruff a diamond, then take a spade finesse.

{
The fact that East passed West's 4S opening suggsts that they
have a stronger variation available or that they simply don't
open 4S with a side ace. Here West was willing to miss the occasional
grand slam in hearts in the interest of making life difficult
for N/S. It was not clear to Weinstein that he could afford to
overtake the CK at trick one, so he simply followed with the
six. As Levin switched to the DA it would seem that Weinstein's
club card was count.

{
North's slightly-shaded Flannery 2D caught south without a good
fit. The worst case scenario for this convention occurs when
responder is a bit stronger, about 11 points, with similar distribution,
Here South wisely chose to play 2H on the five-two fit, rather
than 2S on the four-three. West sagely stayed out of the auction.
All the breaks favored N/S on this deal: three-three splits in
the majors, S-AK in front of the queen, C-KQ and D-KQ behind
the CA and DA. West led a trump, usually a good idea with a balanced
hand and strong spades.

hand, doubled, and found an excellent trump lead to prevent heart
ruffs in dummy. South won in dummy to lead low to his DK. At
this point, West could not know to duck; he took the DA, and
continued spades. After finishing trumps, South led another diamond,
judging well to insert dummy's D9 when West played low.

The next opponents for our sitting pair are the young Israeli
partnership of Schneider & Roll, who will be appearing later
in the week, in the Reisinger as part of the e-bridge junior
squad. The North hand would make a typical problem for a bidding
panel - what should you bid after the auction starts 1H-1S? Levin
did not have to guess which major to stress as he and Weinstein
play Flannery, making it a near certainty that South held at
least a five-card suit for his 1S response.

Josef Roll resisted the temptation to open the East hand with
an ultra-aggressive, European-style weak two. When his partner
overcalled in his long suit, though, he decided that it was time
to introduce a little subterfuge - hence the psychic 1NT advance.
N/S bid to their easy spade game comfortably enough but, when
West doubled (on the basis of his partner's strength-showing
1NT bid), West's double of 4S, unfortunately for the Israelis,
gave East the choice between minus 690 and minus 800.
