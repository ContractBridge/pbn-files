{
OR - You do or you don't - Dorthe Schaltz didn't, and Peter cannot
have been too disappointed. Although the club suit was worth
four tricks, declarer is still a fair way short of nine. Seven
became eight when Helgemo led a spade into the tenace, and four
rounds of clubs got a heart discard from West (although nothing
mattered with the suit 3-3) and a spade from East. Declarer ducked
a heart, won the spade continuation and cashed the HA. He conceded
a trick to the last outstanding heart and claimed a disappointing
nine tricks. NS plus 150.

CR - Erik Saelensminde did, but even after Blakset also led a
spade Brogeland can't have been too happy with nothing much more
than a 3-3 break to rely on for a non-vulnerable game. The Scandinavian
sun shone down on Norway today, though. Easy game, bridge! NS
plus 400 and 6 IMPs to Norway to start this local needle match.

OR - The conservative action was again in the Open Room, and

2H showed a good diamond raise, Helness's 3H showed a poor heart
raise, and there matters rested. With three top tricks off in
the minors and an unavoidable spade loser, declarer needed hearts
2-2 just to score nine tricks. They were: EW plus 140.

CR - Brogeland started with 1NT and Blakset's 2C showed hearts
and another. Saelensminde, with the most solid of heart stoppers,
opened 3NT, sticking it to Bruun. At favorable vulnerability,
he elected to take insurance. 4H-X proved to be cheap - only
minus 100. Unfortunately, that of course meant that 3NT had six
top losers and the insurance policy had cost 8 IMPs (14 if you
think you would have doubled with that powerful East hand!).
Another 6 IMPs to Norway: 12-0.

EW hand the contract was not as good as the combined 29 HCP would
suggest. Dorthe attacked in hearts and declarer ducked to the
third round. When the suit split evenly, things looked much rosier
for declarer. He now had ample time to establish a second winner
in each other pointed suits: Nine tricks; EW plus 600.

OR - Another routine 3NT, but the natural auction gets the contract
played the wrong way round. Not that even Zia would have found
the SQ lead, which beats the contract out of hand. Peter Schaltz
naturally led the HJ and Helness won in hand to knock out the
CA. He allowed the HQ to win and then took North's club exit
in dummy. Cashing the five red-suit winners then squeezed North
out of her long club, so declarer played king and another club
to leave Dorthe Schaltz endplayed to lead away from the SA at
trick 12: Nine tricks; EW plus 600.

Mathias Bruun ducked a spade to the bare ace next. Bruun therefore

liked his club pips enough to opt for defense. The opening lead
gave declarer the spade finesse and cashing his winners (Helgemo
unblocking the DK under the ace) and taking a heart ruff gave
him the first six tricks. East could play one trump through and
Helgemo could get out with a diamond, but he could not avoid
the trump endplay at trick twelve. NS plus 180.

risky and Blakset ran to 2S, but Saelensminde competed to 3C
to end matters. With less information to go on, Brogeland used
his dummy entry to lead trumps, but the effect was the same as
the defenders then had to force him later, allowing him to score
his small trump. The same endplay then brought declarer's total
to eight tricks, but that was one short at this table: NS minus
100. 7 IMPs to Denmark. Norway 12-8 now.

Unfortunately for the young Norwegians, the hands fit terribly.

the contract cheaply. After her pass, Helness showed hearts and
another suit, and Helgemo asked for the second suit (with 2D).

suit, so he bid 3S (pass or correct to 4C). The defenders found
their club ruff, but with trumps now 2-2, Helgemo had time to

what to do with that was not one of the closer decisions Helness
has made during his international career! Helness cashed his
club winners, found his diamond ruff, and waited for his trump
tricks: four down; NS minus 800.

{
CR - Remarkably, the Norwegian NS made a valiant effort to flatten
their teammates' good board. The big difference at this table
was that it was South who made the 4S bid. Before Bruun could
get his hands on that, Blakset had already bid at the 5-level.
Declarer seems to have only two losers, but he does not have
11 tricks. Blakset eventually ran out of trumps: one down. EW
minus 50. 14 IMPs to Norway, who re-take the lead 39-36.

{
OR - The match finished with a fairly dull game hand for NS.
Dorthe opened a weak no trump and denied a 4-card major over
Peter's Forcing Stayman 2D. Peter then showed his fifth heart
and was raised to game. Helgemo's diamond lead was not one of
his better shots, and declarer was eventually able not only to
pick up the diamonds for no loser but to pitch his club on the
fourth diamond: 13 tricks; NS plus 710.

{
CR - Here Saelensminde started with 1D and rebid 1NT. Brogeland
found out about the 3-card hearts support via a 2C inquiry and
raised himself to game. The spade lead gave declarer nothing,
so eventually had to lose a trick in each minor: NS plus 650.
2 IMPs to Denmark. Norway win the match by 39-39. An honorable
draw - 15-15 in VPs.
