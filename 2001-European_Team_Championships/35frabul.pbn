{
OR - Entering this final round, both teams are in contention
for the final Bermuda Bowl qualifying spot. A big win for either
team will likely see them through. A defeat will certainly mean
elimination. As we will see, both sides had plenty of chances
for that big win. The first board was a mundane game deal. The
Bulgarians used a 4-level transfer to reach 4S. Quantin led a
high club and switched to the DK. Declarer won, drew trumps and
threw one diamond loser: 11 tricks; EW plus 450.

a 2-level transfer and raise. Allegrini kept playing when his
counterpart had claimed. When the trumps were run, North discarded
the C10 and now declarer had a ruffing finesse against South
to set up a pitch for the other diamond loser: 12 tricks. 1 IMP
to France to start the match. [Your host Marc Smith]

OR - Multon had a nice hand, but was it really as nice as it
sounded during the bidding. He started by doubling Stamatov's
strong notrump and, when Quantin pulled to 2H, he jumped to 3S.
Quantin had a little something and he raised to game, hoping
that it would prove useful. It didn't. Multon had six potential
losers in his hand and lost all six of them: three down; NS minus
300. Perhaps later in the match, if he had needed a swing, Ivo
Karaivanov would have taken a bite out of 4S.

CR - By contrast, Kalin Karaivanov trod extremely warily with
the North hand. He came in over Palau's strong notrump with 2D
(spades and another) and just bid a quiet 2S when Trendafilov
relayed with 2H ('I don't have a spade fit'). He was no doubt
surprised to find that even 2S was too high: one down; NS minus
100. 5 IMPs to Bulgaria. It would have been 12 if Karaivanov

OR - This time it was Quantin with the good hand - he opened
2C and jumped to show at least semi-solid spades at his second
turn. Multon simply raised to game and, with an ace, he must
have expected the contract to be an easy make. And it usually
would be, but Stamatov found the heart lead, won the SA perforce
at trick two, and delivered a heart ruff. A club through the
king gave the defenders a second heart ruff and there was still
a second club trick to come: two down. NS minus 100.

time with a cue-bid before launching into Blackwood and then
briskly applying the brakes at the 5-level when two key cards
were missing. After the rocky distribution of the previous two

find the diamonds breaking. NS plus 650.

Stamatov gave up and settled for game. As is often the case when
both players have a little to spare, they were too low. By the
time he had to decide on the club finesse, declarer knew that
North's last two cards were both hearts: 12 tricks; NS plus 490.

CR - Having already bid his hearts twice, Allegrini had an easy
3D bid at his third turn. Now Palau could see the potential of
the hand. Palau could have guessed a black-suit finesse for his
twelfth trick, but he elected to play for the double squeeze,
which would work if South held both SQ and CK, and if North had
either both or just the SQ along with the HJ. Indeed, declarer
did not even need the SJ, as neither defender could keep three
spades in the ending. 12 tricks; EW plus 920. 10 IMPs to France.
France lead 11-5.

ducked too, allowing declarer to score the D10 in hand. A club

continued hearts on winning SA. Declarer ruffed but he now had
to overtake the SJ to get to hand, and in so doing created a
trump winner for Palau. Declarer must now cash the S10 (or HA
then S10), but Karaivanov led the D10 without doing so. Had Allegrini
covered with the queen, the game would have been defeated. He
didn't and the D10 held, so declarer continued the suit to jack

finesse to take. Multon's decision to take the club finesse was
not unreasonable. It was the wrong decision today, though. The
winning line is to put up the CA, play a spade to the queen,
cash SA, and play four hearts, throwing clubs from dummy, and
crossruff. The defenders can score the SK whenever they like.

{
CR - Palau was not taxed by the play in 1H. On the diamond lead,
he could have made nine tricks by using the CK entry to dummy
to play a spade to the jack and subsequently pinning the SQ on
the second round. In fact, he played spades from hand and emerged
with eight tricks: EW plus 110. 5 IMPs to France. Bulgaria lead
19-17 at the halfway point. If it stays like this, a 15-15 VP
draw will eliminate both teams and allow someone else through
to claim the last place in Bali.

a major-suit lead gives the defense a chance. Declarer won with
the CA and immediately returned the suit, and with plenty of
entries to dummy he could not be prevented from making four clubs,
three diamonds and two major-suit aces. 5 IMPs to Bulgaria when

is unbeatable. The French never found their hearts, so they played
in spades but missed game, while the Bulgarians got to game in

4H is not a thing of beauty. On any mundane trump division where
the defenders could simply lead two rounds of trumps, killing
the ruffing spade finesse, declarer would have four unavoidable
losers. Declarer needed trumps specifically 4-1 with a singleton
ace or 5-0, and the king of spades third in the hand with short
trumps. And so it was. Bridge is an easy game: NS plus 420.

CR - Palau's decision to rebid 3C on this very ordinary hand
was no doubt influenced by the seventh club, but it is still
very aggressive. Allegrini might have passed, but jump rebids
are sometimes based on 3-card support, and if West has something
like a 3-2-2-6 16-count, then 4S is likely to be a fine contract.
If not, then 3NT should be playable. Opposite this West hand,
it was hopeless. The defenders took the first six tricks - four
diamonds and two spades. 14 IMPs to Bulgaria who are back in
the match now: France 43-38.

OR - The Bulgarians competed to 3D, but went quietly when Multon
raised himself to game. One obvious route to ten tricks is a
ruffing club finesse. Rather than commit himself in that way,
Multon set about a crossruff. Eventually, he had a count of the
hand and knew that West had only one trump. He therefore ruffed
the third club high and finessed the H10. If that had won, he
would have ruffed the fourth round of clubs with the king and
crossed to the HA to throw his last spade on the long club. Unfortunately
for France, West's heart was the jack! Two down, NS minus 100.

CR - Although Multon might have made 4H, 5H was clearly hopeless
as it has three top losers. Allegrini did something very good
for his side when he jumped to 4S, as it pushed Trendafilov overboard.
Did he really think that 5S was making? Did the opponents' bidding
sound as if they had balanced hands and everything would break
nicely in 5S? In the circumstances, he should probably count
himself lucky to get out for one down: EW minus 200. 7 IMPs to
Bulgaria, back in front: 45-43.

{
OR - 6C is a pretty fair slam. It is virtually cold on a 2-2
club break, and if trumps are 3-1 in needs spades to come in
with one ruff (or a winning guess if South holds Qxxx). The Bulgarians
didn't get close to bidding it - Stamatov opened 2S (weak with
spades and another). Karaivanov found out that his partner had
clubs and picked 3NT. Declarer allowed the DJ to win trick one,
and having no outside entry Quantin switched to a spade. There
was no joy there, and declarer took a heart finesse for 12 tricks:
EW plus 690.

{
CR - The French at least investigated slam. Palau, not unreasonably,
thought this West hand was a 1-level opening bid and he raised
the 2C response to the 4-level. Trendafilov's doubled allowed
Allegrini to cue-bid both red suits, but he could not get any
further encouragement from Palau. EW plus 620. 2 IMPs to Bulgaria
when either side might have gained a slam swing. Bulgaria win
the match 47-43, 16-14 in VPs. France finished 7th, just 4 VPs
behind Israel, who claimed 5th spot. The Bulgarians finished
8th.
