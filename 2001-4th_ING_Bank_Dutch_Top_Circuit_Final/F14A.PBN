{
4H is on and 5C is a good save. When Jeroen Top decides to make
a weak jump overcall in spades, those contemplations suddenly
lose all their relevance.

{
West double shows a one suiter and North's 2H is a transfer to
spades. Sloppy defence and dummy play levels and results to the
legitimate score: NS minus 100.

{
In a Puppet Stayman auction South sizes the opportunity to make
a lead directing double on a good three card. Good show by young
Simon de Wijs, because after three rounds of diamonds, declarer
still has to find the the HQ. Apparently it was difficult for
De Wijs to read the lead properly, since he did not continue
in diamonds at trick two.
