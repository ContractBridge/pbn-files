{
Nice hand, NS may make 3NT and certainly the unlikely heart game.
Understandably, Venice Cup holder Wietske van Zwol and her new
partner Femke Hoogweg bid to 5@C. Bas Drijver leads a diamond
to his partner's jack. Simon de Wijs now wisely switches to a
trump, necessary to beat the contract. Declarer doesn't attempt
to ruff a heart in dummy (a second trump would kill that possibility)
but draws trumps and tries a heart to the queen. The king is
offside, but the suit divides 3-3: one down.

[Contract "4S"]
[Declarer "W"]
{
After a constructive, non-forcing 2@S response to the weak 2@H,
East has a case to jump to game. South finds the best lead, a
trump. North should have taken the first trick and continued
the suit. Nevertheless, declarer is still without a chance. It
looks as if NS - with 26 HCP together - have been talked out
of something. But out of what? 6@C looks like a reasonable contract,
but bad breaks bring even game in jeopardy.

{
Although West shows a weak major two-suiter with his 2@D opening
bid, Hoogweg-Van Zwol do very well to reach 4@S. The popular
opening bid backfires since Femke Hoogweg is now able to find
the excellent play of leading the @SJ at trick 2! Simon de Wijs
ducks smoothly; no chance with Femke.

{
A conflict of two rules: 'always lead a major against notrump'
and 'always lead your longest and strongest'. Simon de Wijs applies
for the latter: on this hand not the right choice. After a spade
lead, EW would get in with the @CA and cash enough spade tricks
to sink the contract.

{
Going down two in 4@H, when 5@C is on. Not a great result for
NS. For me in my chair with the full diagram right in front of
me it is not difficult to say that 'of course' North should have
overcalled 3@C over 2@S. But even then, wouldn't South bid 4@H
over 3@S?

{
Instead of pass, being South I would have bid 3@D over 2@H. That
approach would surely lead to 5@D doubled minus one. Not a success
story. In real life - after her initial pass - Wietske doubles
4@H for penalties. Declarer never has a chance, but with careful
play he manages to keep control for one down only.
