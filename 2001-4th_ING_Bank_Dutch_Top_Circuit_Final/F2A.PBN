{
A partscore hand won by NS in 2@S. EW might compete with 3@H,
but there are several ways to beat that contract. Note that Erik
Kirchhoff (former coach of the Dutch Open Team) bids 2@D against
his own principles: 'When you overcall at the two level, you
should have at least six'...

{
Another boring board? It looks like NS are talked out of 3NT,
but the obvious heart lead or switch is killing. 1@H can be dealt
with quick and dirty: club, club, club. South ruffs and NS still
get two trumps, the @DA and a spade. At the table, Nico Doremans
leads a diamond for his partner's ace. Each time NS get in, they
play diamonds. Kirchhoff now makes his contract by ruffing the
fourth spade in dummy and endplaying south, who is forced to
lead from his trump tenace. Handsome!

{
For beginners. Everybody will reach a small slam in spades. What
counts is how to handle the trump suit correctly. Just start
by cashing a high spade from hand, like Jaap Trouwborst does,
and you still manage to finesse jack-fourth of trumps both ways.
Here it pays off to do so.

{
A very difficult hand to bid. NS have long suits and lots of
points but no clear fit. Jaap Trouwborst - the non-playing captain
of the Dutch Open Team - thinks that in view of the 2NT rebid
he can be sure of at least two spades in dummy and settles for
6@S. Unfortunately for him, spades don't behave. Even worse,
6NT and 6@D are on.

[Contract "4H"]
[Declarer "N"]
{
A good result for NS: 4@H made. It has everything to do with
the odd looking 3@S bid by Erik Kirchhoff. If he elected to 'sell'
his hand as a two-suiter (why not?), he would have given his
partner a chance to bid 5@C. Vulnerable against not, this turns
out to be a good sacrifice (one down, like 4@S).

{
In third seat, Doremans sees no problem in having eleven points
for his 3@D opening. Paulissen overcalls 3@H and is raised to
game. The diamond lead is won by the king. Doremans returns his
singleton and ruffs the club return, but that's all for NS: ten
tricks. An unlikely lead of the @CA does not sink the contract.
South cannot reach his partner for a second ruff.

{
An exciting 6@H for NS. If West leads anything but a club, declarer
establishes the diamond suit. After a club lead, declarer finesses.
Bad luck, East wins the king and returns a trump, killing the
spade ruff. Now it looks like declarer is out of hope, lacking
an entry to set up the diamonds. Is he? South plays all his trumps
and squeezes EW with spades as the anchor suit. What are we talking
about anyway? NS peacefully rest in 3NT.

{
Gert-Jan Paulissen displays a typical example of the popular
Multi-Landy system against 1NT. Under this agreement, 2@D shows
a one-suited hand with hearts or spades. Eight simple tricks
for Kirchhoff, who has the honour to play the hand with his singleton
trump.

[Contract "4S"]
[Declarer "E"]
{
A simple 4@S, in which a trump trick and the @HA are lost. Kirchhoff-Paulissen
use the 'Dutch doubleton' system. The 1@C opening bid is forcing
(not necessarily strong) and after the natural and positive 1@S
response, 2@D is a relay rebid. 2@H shows exactly four spades
and 3@S establishes the trump suit, leaving space for cue-bidding.
Not needed here, but very useful on more slam-oriented hands.
