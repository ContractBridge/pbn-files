{
OR - Armstrong was never bidding game, even after Hackett's transfer
break - maximum (in principle) with four spades and a pure heart
doubleton (either two low or A-x). Nor was it a good game. To
avoid two diamond losers, declarer needs a very good lie of the
cards if he has to lead the suit and a fair one even if the defense
does so. Armstrong's line (running the D8 early) is not best
as it relies on a misdefense, but at 10am in the morning for
an overtrick - who cares? 3S just made; NS plus 140. (Your host
for the final segment of this QF is Marc Smith)

[Declarer "N"]
{
CR - The Poles breezed into 4S, perhaps fortunately. Pszczola
began with a two-way (Strong/Artificial or weak NT) 1C, and 1D
was either negative or various minor-suit semi-positives. Over
1S, Gawrys presumably intended 3S as pre-emptive. Whether Pszcola
realized this and bid on because he had a maximum with good controls
or whether he expected more, I cannot say. Jason opted for a
'safe' diamond. That solved Pszczola's guess in the suit and
soon claimed ten tricks; NS plus 420. 7 IMPS to e-bridge, narrowing
the gap to just 2 IMPs, 65-67.

{
OR - Mohan/Lev combined well to give Papa Hackett a decision
he could never get right. First, Mohan passed knowing that whichever
Hackett Minor held it in the other room would not. Then Lev's
heavy 3rd-seat pre-empt really stuck it to Hackett, whose realistic
options were all losing ones. At least 3NT escaped undoubled
- something that 4H would not have done. Lev played the S10 at
Trick 1, ensuring communications. Mohan duly gained the lead
in hearts and played a second spade while Leve still had the
CA. 3NT down three; NS minus 300.

{
OR - Mohan/Lev got overboard, although most pairs would reach
a no play game on a combined 25 count with an 8-card major-suit
fit. East's spade bid doubtless encouraged Lev to look favourably
upon his SK, and although the hand is not very good for a jump
to 3H, bidding less would be a distinct view. Mohan's raise also
looks fairly normal too. The defenders cashed their three top
winners without mishap, and when trumps failed to break Lev was
two down; EW minus 200.

to duck this, but he won the king and forced declarer with a

CR - An unopposed auction meant that it was West who took control
via Blackwood at this table. He knew about the heart stops but
not that his brother's diamonds were solid, so the correction
to the notrump slam looks normal. The defenders did not lead
a heart here, and North was subsequently squeezed in the black

OR - Both West players decided this was a Weak Two in hearts,
the 4-card spade suit notwithstanding. Lev had to start with
a Multi and Hackett's double showed a moderate quasi-balanced
hand. Armstrong's double of the 2H relay showed hearts in case
West's suit was spades, and now Hackett cue-bid to ask for more
information. Armstrong showed his heart stopper and Hackett opted
to play 3NT. The defense forced Armstrong to abandon one of dummy's
minors but he couldn't get it wrong, since both queens were onside.

major-suits lying well for him, Hackett had plenty of time to

CR - Jason predictably opened 1S as East. Gawrys began with a
double and bid a simple 2H over his partner's minimum response.
Pszczola judged correctly that he had enough for an invitation
and Gawrys had an easy acceptance. Another push board. HACKETT
by 74-69 with six deals to play.

OR - The British 1H opening uncovered the NS fit immediately.
Mohan competed over 2H with a takeout double and Lev retreated
to his decent 5-card major. Declarer attempted to play on diamonds
to establish a discard for a losing club but he had no chance
with that suit lying poorly. Had he set about establishing dummy's
thirteenth club, the defenders would no doubt have switched to
diamonds in time to foil that plan too. 2S down one; EW minus
50.

shut out the hearts when Pszczola preferred to show his spade
stop via 1NT in preference to making a negative double. Jason
had no reason to get involved, so there matters rested. The defence
attacked spades and Pszczola set about establishing his hearts,

declarer's defeat. Armstrong won the HA when, with hearts 3-3
and the DA on his left, ducking would have ensured the contract
without any nasty guesses. When diamonds failed to come in, the
defenders forced an entry to the East hand with the HQ, and Armstrong
misguessed on the inevitable club switch. Indeed, he should have
been FIVE down, but Mohan did not see the CK come down on the
other side of the screen, so he did not cash his four club winners.
Still, that was one down, and NS minus 100.

CR - Curiously, the play to the first trick was the same at this
table. Play then continued to follow that at the other table,
and Gawrys also misguessed the clubs. However, on winning with
the CQ Justin switched back to hearts rather than playing a second
club. Instead of the contract failing by five tricks, giving
HACKETT a 9-IMP gain and a 17-IMP lead with four deals to play
thanks to the vaguaries of screens, declarer now had nine tricks.
NS plus 600 and 12 IMPs to e-bridge, reclaiming the lead 81-77.

the odd non-Hackett might have opened 1H, and thus Armstrong
was allowed to open a strong NT in third seat and buy the contract.
The opening club lead and continuation gave declarer his sixth
trick, but he then fell from grace by winning the first heart.

when Pszczola responded in his cheapest 3-card suit. At this

the defenders did not attack trumps, so declarer was allowed

OR - John Mohan must be a truly great defender, for this time
he passed on a hand that even Al Roth might have considered opening.
It worked well for him, though, as Armstrong/Hackett conducted
a quatitative auction to a slam that had to fail when the hands
fitted very poorly. Had Hackett known that his CK was worthless,
he would doubtless have been more conservative. The 3-3 spade
break was no good to Armstrong - he needed the SQ to come down
doubleton. 6H down one; NS minus 50.

OR - Hand too strong for a weak notrump rebid with 1444 shapes
are tough customers, and Armstrong chose to handle it in the
traditional British style by opening his chunky 4-card major.
A case can be made for rebidding an overweight 1NT, but Armstrong's
decision to bid a minor would find favor with many. It was unfortunate
that he chose diamonds and not clubs, for 2C would have been
a much more comfortable spot than the 4-2 heart fit. Armstrong
endplayed Mohan in diamonds at the end for his fifth trick; NS
minus 300.
