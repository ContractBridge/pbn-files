{
OR - After a third of the second quarter final match, Australia/Argentina
led Indonesia by 46-28 IMPs. Indonesia was playing four-handed,
and were without their anchor pair, Sacul- Karwur. Panelewen,
East, judged well, leaving Robert Parasian to play a comfortable
2S. The 16 HCP was control-rich, but his pattern and loser-count
were unappetizing for any further move. Lambardi led the CQ,
which unfortunately killed a club trick, and when declarer stripped
Ravenna's exit cards, there were nine tricks: plus 140 for E/W.

{
CR - Paul Marston and Ishmael Del'Monte play Moscito, a "major-oriented
strong club" system with relays. Del'Monte's "strong"1C showed
15+ , and Lasut tried to make life difficult for the opponents
with a weak 2D overcall. Marston's double was, in essence, a
takeout bid. When he followed up with a natural 2S, he limited
his hand.  East, with his DK devalued, really should have passed,
but aggressively advanced  with 2NT. The DQ held the first trick,
and when  Manoppo smoothly ducked his SK, declarer managed only
seven tricks. Down one: minus 50 for E/W, and 5 IMPs.

{
OR - The Argentine pair conducted a forcing notrump auction ending
in 2S. A direct raise would have announced constructive values.
As you can see, Lambardi was under no illusions about the lacklustre
distribution and three jacks. Parasian led the CK, and then found
the effective switch to the H4. The defense had positioned themselves
to take two spades, two hearts, one diamond and one club. This
was done in due course, and declarer failed by one trick: minus
100 for N/S.

{
CR - The Indonesian pair were under no such constraints playing
Precision. Manoppo simply raised to 2S, secure in the knowledge
that Lasut would have to take control with a distributional hand
if game was to be considered. Marston also led a high club, and
then shifted to the H4. Lasut attacked the trump suit in a slightly
different manner than his counterpart, but also lost only two
trump tricks. Down one: minus 100 for N/S, and no swing. Australia/Argentina
ahead 46-33 IMPs with plenty of time left.

OR - Panelewen's 2D continuation after the 12-14 notrump rebid
was artificial and game-forcing. The five-three spade fit was
uncovered, and E/W were in 4S quickly. Ravenna's H6 lead (third
from an even number) went to the nine, ten, and queen. Declarer
took the losing heart finesse now, as the HA would later park
the losing diamond in hand. When the black suits behaved perfectly
for declarer, he had eleven tricks: plus 650 for E/W.

CR - Marston's 1NT showed 11-14 HCP, and denied a five-card major.
All limited 4333 hands must be opened 1NT. Del' Monte used Stayman,
found no four-card major, and bid a direct 4S, perhaps because
he feared one of his two doubletons in notrump or that an artificial
relay sequence might attract an unwanted lead-directing double.
Lasut's H7 lead went to Manoppo's king, and declarer had an easy
eleven tricks when Marston produced a very suitable dummy. Plus
650 for E/W, and no swing.

{
OR - The Argentine auction has some points of interest. After
Lambardi's transfer to hearts, Ravenna announced a super-accept
with a doubleton diamond (3D). Lambardi's 4D bid was a re-transfer
to hearts allowing the contract to be played by the strong hand.
Parasian found the S9 lead to the jack, king, and ace. Declarer
had a simple route to success by immediately discarding his spades
on the high clubs, and playing a diamond. When he cashed two
high hearts, he telescoped his ten tricks into nine: down one,
and minus 100 for N/S.

{
CR - Marston's 2S opening is described as an undisciplined 5-10
HCP, precisely five spades. Spot on. Lasut balanced with a natural
2NT. When Manoppo transferred to hearts, Lasut had an easy 4H
call with his prime holding. Marston's D6 lead eased declarer's
problems somewhat, and there were ten tricks available. When
declarer claimed, it seems the entire table forgot about the
HQ, and eleven tricks were recorded. Plus 650 for N/S, and 13
IMPs to Indonesia - knotting the match at 46 all.

{
OR - A disciplined pass by Lambardi in first seat with the flat
twelve-count. His 2C bid was Drury-fit, and Ravenna admitted
to a real opening bid with 2D (2H would deny a real opener).
Lambardi suggested notrump, and Ravenna was happy to comply with
his flat distribution. Panelewen's diamond lead certainly gave
declarer a few anxious moments, but with the heart suit breaking,
and split heart honors (not to mention the spade finesse working),
declarer had nine tricks: plus 600 for N/S. Declarer's attempt
for a tenth trick in the end position was thwarted.

CR - Manoppo, playing Precision, could open the borderline North
hand, and his 1NT rebid showed 12-14 HCP. Lasut bid an artificial
checkback - 2C. Marston doubled this, in case partner would be
on lead against a notrump contract. He may have regretted this
action if Manoppo had redoubled, and Lasut had stood for it.
A rather strange plus 760 number N/S would have been notched.
In any event, Manoppo showed his three-card heart support, and
Lasut was in 4H the next moment. Declarer lost the obvious three
tricks: plus 620 for N/S, and 1 IMP Indonesia. New leaders.

OR - A textbook weak 2D opening from Panelewen had Ravenna overcalling
his chunky heart suit at the two-level, silencing everyone. The
D10 was led, and East won a subtle DQ, and returned his jack.
East had a choice of nine different suit preference plays at
trick one and two (one of the three honors won - and, which of
the two remaining honors returned) - you may judge the implications.
An entertaining middle-game club trick (please go through the
play) provided declarer with nine tricks: plus 140 for N/S.

CR - The "Moscito" 1S opening showed 9-14 HCP, with six-plus
diamonds, and possibly a four-card major, or five-four-plus in
clubs and diamonds, the former being a very accurate depiction.
This attracted a 2H overcall from Lasut, and just like the Open
Room, it was met by three rapid passes. Here, the D10 was taken
by the ace (removing the suit preference options), East playing
a reverse-attitude D3. Here, declarer secured only one club trick
when he played a club to the queen. Plus 110 for N/S, and 1 IMP
to Australia/Argentina. Tied again at 47 IMPs.

OR - The Argentines conducted a very controlled auction to a

3H denied a doubleton heart, 3S was a cue-bid, 4H was a slow-down
bid, 5C a cue-bid, and 6D offered a choice-of-slams. The CA was
led, and a club returned. West played a thoughtful D7 on dummy's
ace at trick three. Declarer, however, essentially had to be
in dummy to take the heart finesse after the third round of trumps,
and was doomed when East showed out on the DK. Down one: minus

CR - In this room, North opted to try a different tack. His 4C
bid was a self-supporting splinter. This implied a slam-try with
a good six-plus-card heart suit and shortness in clubs, usually
with no second suit. South looked at the KQJ of clubs, the minimum
4333 distribution, and signed off. North, somewhat pessimistically,
passed, respecting the finality of 4H. After the SJ lead, declarer

OR - South's 2C bid was game-forcing allowing the 2H bid on less
than reverse values. Surprisingly, East didn't double 3NT for
a diamond lead. This appears to be a big position.  Although,
a double may help South to re-evaluate, and escape to the making
5C (declarer must carefully ruff the second diamond high) or
even 4H (without a spade lead), the failure to double can be
more expensive, as here. When the H3 was led against 3NT, declarer

of a 2H bid. That would be a reverse, showing distributional
values in their Precision structure. Manoppo also feared he would
wrong-side notrump if he rebid 2NT with that spade holding. Hence,
his waiting bid of 2D. When Lasut jumped to 3NT, East was under
no illusions as to what suit he wanted led, and doubled. Certainly,
either North or South should have expressed some doubt about
this contract (redouble?). When neither did - down three: minus
500 for N/S. 14 IMPs to Aus/Arg, in front by one!

and led the SA. The S8 was continued, declarer winning the king
to ruff a club. He felt the HK was offside on the auction. When
the S9 was ruffed with the HQ, and over-ruffed by the king, North
delivered partner his diamond ruff. Another spade received the
precious H9 - South's H10 had been upper-cut for one down: minus
200 for E/W.

CR - Manoppo, even if he had wanted to, couldn't open 2D, as
that would have been Multi. Del' Monte's 1D opening showed four
or more hearts, and 9-14 HCP. Marston's 2C bid was natural (as
three-of-a-minor would be weak), and forcing for one round. The
auction continued in a natural vein, ending in 3H. Del 'Monte
had announced the lower range (9-11 HCP), and Marston made a
very disciplined pass. A similar set of circumstances led to
the same nine tricks: plus 140 for E/W. 8 IMPs to Australia/Argentina,
now leading 69-60.

OR - Lambardi chose to get his hand-type across in one swift
motion. His 2NT bid showed a balanced 10-11 HCP, and a club stopper.
A pretty fair description. Ravenna raised to 3NT, and N/S had
avoided the dangerous spade game. The combined N/S club holding
ensured that either contract would make. The club spots allowed
three tricks in the suit. The defense took one club and two diamonds,

by the last two results at his table. When Lasut bid 2S instead,
Manoppo went for the notrump game with similar thoughts to Lambardi's

Not vulnerable vs vulnerable, he would be more inclined to act.

Ten easy tricks were available in that strain. The S5 lead didn't
trouble declarer, and he emerged with nine tricks, losing only
two hearts, one diamond, and one club. Plus 140 for N/S.

{
CR - Marston did double at his second turn, but in a slightly
different scenario. Lasut's 1D opening was Precision, so West's
double had more of a three-suit takeout implication to it. As
Del 'Monte could use a scramble 2NT in this auction, his 3D announced
a fifth card. Manoppo went on to 3H, and was greeted by a penalty
double from East. The C6 was led, and two club ruffs were delivered
(the second was a natural trump trick). The defense awaited the
SK for a breath-taking down one. Minus 100 for N/S, and 6 IMPs
to Australia/Argentina, ahead by 15.

OR - E/W conducted a two-over-one game-forcing auction to a normal
4H contract. Panelewen decided to create a force with 2C as a
simple route of describing his hand. He could then support hearts
at his second turn, giving partner captaincy. The C3 was led
(lowest from odd), and declarer won the queen. West eschewed
the restricted choice play in hearts, because he wanted to be
in hand for the second club finesse. Declarer lost one spade
and one heart when the spade honors proved to be split: eleven
tricks, and plus 450 for E/W.

for 4H, and Manoppo led the S4. This sold the spade suit out
just as in the Open Room. In the end-game, North unguarded his

OR - The natural Indonesian auction alighted in a very sound
four-three spade fit at the one-level. N/S really had no reason
to enter the auction, and Ravenna led the SK in an effort to
cut down a potential cross-ruff that often presents itself on
this type of auction. The trick came back when the defense managed
a second heart trick. Declarer could  arrive at only seven tricks
after this start, when the defense arranged to take one spade,
two hearts, two diamonds, and one club. Plus 80 for E/W.

light, but a close approximation. This resulted in a rather tenuous
five-one heart fit at the two-level. The defense was deadly,
and accurate. Declarer was held to one spade, two hearts, and
one club: down four. Minus 200 for E/W - mercifully non-vulnerable.

his bid was taken away. Ravenna advanced with 2NT to request
North's minor, and East's competitive 3H was raised to 4H by

prove to be the undoing of the contract. The S4 lead was won

avoid losing two diamonds and two hearts for down one: minus

in 3NT. Lambardi decided to treat his hand as balanced, and his
2H rebid was either a balanced hand of 22 HCP or more, or a strong
two-bid in hearts. Ravenna bid a forced 2S puppet to find out
the nature of the beast, and 2NT showed 22-23 HCP balanced. Three
quarters of the deck and two balanced hands led Ravenna quickly
to 3NT. Obviously, on a perfect fit, slam in a minor may have
a play. Ravenna's jacks dictated caution in that regard. Declarer
safely gathered in nine tricks: plus 400 for N/S.
