{
OR - And then they were only two... Magnus Lindkvist and Björn
Fallenius of Sweden, European Team Champions in 1987, split up
in 1990, but have recently resumed their old partnership. Here
they take on Americans Sam Lev and John Mohan, winners of the
transnational mixed teams in Maastricht 2000. Lindkvist's 1C
was either a balanced 11-13 or any 17+, and 1NT showed the strong
type. 2C was Stayman, but 3NT looks wrong with only one heart
stopper. Why not 3D, in case South has five spades? On the HQ
lead, Lindkvist had no chance. Minus 50.

CR - At this table, both the Polish world champions Jacek Pszcola
and Piotr Gawrys and their Swedish opponents, Per-Olof Sundelin
and Johan Sylvan use a two-way 1C opening (either a balanced
minimum [11-13/12-14] or any 17/18+), just like Lindkvist and
Fallenius at the other table. But here, Pszcola protected with
2D rather than 1NT with his suit-oriented hand - and when Gawrys
showed his spades, the correct game was found. Plus 420. First
blood to e-bridge, leading 10-0. {Your host for this match: Anders

1S and 2D was relays with the strong type, and when Lindkvist
showed a balanced minimum, Fallenius ended proceedings with 3NT.
With the contract played from the right side, a heart lead wasn't
threating (and the ace was onside anyway), so Lindkvist wrapped
up ten tricks quickly. Plus 630.

strong club systems, so Gawrys opened with 1D and rebid 2C, hoping
to get another chance. He didn't, and when the HA was onside
he scored eleven easy tricks. Plus 150, and 10 IMPs back to Sweden,
making the score even: 10-10. Raising to 3C opposite a limited
opening would have been ambitous, but Pszcola could have hedged
his bets with a 2D preference - just to keep the ball alive.

{
CR - In spite of his three hearts, Gawrys chose to rebid 3S,
to stress his strong suit. The disadvantage with this bulky rebid
is that it pre-empts the further bidding and makes it very difficult
for Pszczola to investigate the best strain. When he guessed
to raise to 4S, and Sylvan led a club, Gawrys was doomed. Spades
were 3-3, but the red suits didn't behave, so nine trick was
all he could get. Minus 50, and a second 10 IMPs swing to Sweden,
now leading 20-10. If you don't want to raise hearts immediately,
why not compromise with 3C?

to be cold, but it looked very playable; and the fact that Fallenius
hadn't revealed anything about his own hand could work to his
advantage in the play. When he played trumps the normal way,
twelve tricks were for the taking. Plus 1430.

CR - Pszczola had only five losers, but only 12 HCP as well,
so he chose a conservative 2H rebid when lesser mortals may have
jumped to 3H. Gawrys had enough to consider slam anyway and simply
asked for key-cards, found one missing, asked for the HQ, got
a negative response, and still raised to 6H. I wonder why he
inquired about the trump queen... When he played trumps the right
way everything was easy. Plus 1430, and a push. Still 20-10 to

opened the bidding and got an artificial 1H response, showing
either 8+ HCP with 4+ spades or a balanced hand with 12+ HCP.
When the rebid confirmed the little hand (11-13 HCP), Fallenius
called it a day. On a low heart lead to the ace and a low heart
back, Lindkvist played low, and Mohan did well to shift to spades.
At that time, Lindkvist could cash seven tricks, but he had a
small black-out and risked the contract with a club to the jack.
Here, he was lucky. Plus 90.

made a strong game try with redouble followed by 2NT. After Sundelin's
HQ lead, the only way to hold declarer to eight tricks is to
rise with the ace and shift to spades. Sylvan's ducking the HQ
only meant it was an overtrick instead of just making. Plus 150

natural with 11-16, but since he used a relay system it could
be difficult to get his distribution across accurately, so he
bided his time with a pass. Lev's 4C opening was a strong 4H
opening, and over Mohan's 4H, Fallenius realized that his initial
pass hadn't made it easier for him to describe his hand. When
he took a stab at 4S, he could have been very wrong (opposite,
say, one spade and four clubs). Now it was a missed slam; plus

had three or more clubs, so Gawrys would have gotten clubs right

but Fallenius may have thought otherwise, and even if he interpreted
it correctly, he probably deemed his hand too weak for 4C. The
defense had many chances to hold declarer to nine tricks, but
when Fallenius shifted to spades after the HK, Lev made an overtrick.
