OR - In the second 16 board stanza of the three-set match between
Senior and Sweden, from the Open Room Liggins/Fawcett play a
strong no-trump with 5-card majors and a loose club, Sundelin/Sylvan
a 2-way club (weak NT or 17+) and a 14-16 no-trump. N/S get in
their opponents' faces but can't stop E/W from finding spades
at the 3 level. Sylvan resists the temptation to hang partner,
and settles for game - a 4H cue-bid mightn't have been absurd
at his final turn? Sylvan has trump entries to take 2 club finesses
and wraps up 12 tricks.

CR - In this Room Senior/Erichsen as E/W, [playing 4-card majors
and a strong NT with 2D weak for the majors and weak twos] get
the auction to themselves. West's hand is tough to describe over
the 2S rebid - it has incredible trumps but nothing else. Erichsen
shows moderate values but when he can't cue-bid over 4C, Senior
shuts up shop. Fallenius leads a club for a painless 480. Incidentally
the Swedes also play a sort of 2-way club with a natural 1D opening
and a 14-16 no-trump. More on that anon - your host Barry Rigal.

18 - OR Sundelin's 1C followed by the simple raise shows 11-13
and four trumps. Sylvan's 3S bid looks to be invitational --
focusing on trumps? Whatever Sylvan wanted Sundelin has --we've
come along way from the days when the East hand was a minimum!
Liggins leads a trump, and Sylvan hops up with the CA to finesse
in trumps. Liggins ducks, then wins the next trump to play a
third one. Sylvan needs miracles now and when he leads the CK
from hand that lets Liggins ruff; down two. There might be lines
for down one by ruffing a heart in dummy.

CR - Here Senior's 4-card major gets his side into game-forcing
territory at once. Over the 2NT trump-raise Senior denies shortage
and E/W subside in 4S on the CQ lead. Senior also wins in the
East hand to take the spade finesse. Lindkvist ducks, and Senior
leads the next spade to his SA rather than ducking -- but he
too has no way to escape down two for a flat board. Still 33-20
for Sweden. [Incidentally while we have space, Fallenius-Lindkvist
are reviving their highly successful Swedish partnership from
the 80's.]

OR - When Liggins does not open in third seat, Sundelin opens
1C then jumps to 3S to show 17+ over the 1S response, which as
you can see may contain a longer minor and only promises four
spades. Liggins' H9 lead lets declarer finesse - no luck there.
He wins in hand and advances a low trump, and would have some
slim chances if he guessed to put in the S8 - but why should
he do that, other than that it would work spectacularly today.
When South discards, Sylvan has to try to escape for down one
- easy enough to do when he guesses the clubs.

{
CR - Lindkvist's macho 1S opening keeps Senior out of that suit
- but 3NT is hardly a bundle of joy either! Of course if you
could guess clubs you would take nine tricks in a canter - but
again, why should you do that? Senior must have considered the
successful line, but the auction points him in the wrong direction.
He misguesses clubs, and the defence have time to clear the diamonds,
and eventually to get in with the HQ to cash out that suit. Down
four and a 'triumph' for four-card majors; or something. 7IMPs
to Sweden, leading now 40-20.

20 OR - Liggins' 1NT rebid shows simply 11-14 without reference
to spades, and Fawcett simply jumps to the obvious game. On the
natural spade lead from Sundelin, Liggins wins in dummy and finesses
in clubs. Sundelin ducks the first, wins the next, and shifts
to a heart - speeding up the play for Liggins who can now claim
ten tricks. With Sundelin at the table, anything you can do to
accelerate the play is always a good idea.

CR - A dull board  becomes interesting when Erichsen steps into
a strong auction; as I understand it, in response to the 1H bid
(spades 8+ or 12+ balanced) Lindkvist showed 11-13 and spade
fit, maximum. Fallenius' 2H bid showed 12+ and now after the
double, why could Fallenius not redouble? But instead he cautiously
retreats to 3NT - and on a low heart lead the defence have lost
their heart tricks. Fallenius sets up clubs and gives up a diamond
at the end for an IMP - it is 41-20 now.

{
OR - We will never know how the defence to 3NT would have gone
in the Open Room, since Sylvan quite reasonably decides not to
risk a tragedy. On best defence of a diamond lead and heart shift
declarer has to guess spades to avoid going two down, so perhaps
it was a wise action. In 4C Fawcett's low diamond lead is systemically
low from a doubleton (and an interesting choice - why not a heart
lead?) In the ending declarer misguesses spades - there were
no inferences about the absence of a weak-jump response, since
N/S do not play them.

{
CR - Fallenius' weak-jump response lets Erichsen double for takeout.
I believe E/W play Lebensohl here so when Senior bids 3C that
shows values (2NT would have been weak with a minor). Erichsen
bids 3S to ask for a heart stop, and when Lindkvist doubles,
Senior thoughtfully passes this back to Erichsen to bid 3NT.
The defence have many ways to set the game - primarily North
must not lead or shift to the SQ. Lindkvist passes the test at
trick one, then falls from grace. 10IMPs to Senior, down 41-30
now.

OR - A spectacular deal; I wish I had more space for it! Sundelin
shows a strong club at his second turn then sells out to 4S -
wisely. On the H9 lead Fawcett's H10 falsecard puts Sundelin
off; he switches to a diamond and Fawcett ruffs and draws two
trumps (all he can afford) to lead the H8 and Sylvan refuses
to ruff; nice play. Now a club to the CK (ducked perforce by
Sundelin) the HK, again ducked, and a club ruff. On the last
heart Sylvan has thrown a club; he ruffs the fourth heart and
should exit with a diamond, but declarer gives up a club and
takes the rest for +420.

CR - Senior's strong no-trump does not get in his opponents'
way; Lindkvist introduces his heart suit -enough for Fallenius
to take a shot at 4H. On the top diamond lead Lindkvist simply
ruffs, crosses to the SJ, and leads a club. if Senior ducked,
that would let Lindkvist play a cross-ruff for 11 tricks. Senior
hops up with the CA however and plays HA and another heart. That
leaves him with the master trump but all of North's diamonds
go on the clubs for 420 and a push board - still Sweden by 41-30.

OR - The natural auction here sees Fawcett with a close decision
as to whether to bid 3NT or pass. The vulnerable game bonus is
too much for him - right he is with 3 queens onside. Liggins
wins the  diamond lead with the DJ and now has 9 tricks. Then
he takes three finesses for 660 - all very satisfactory. This
dull board gives me space to say that Liggins/Fawcett debuted
for England in Maastricht with spectacular success (they lost
in the semis to Italy, having outshot all expectations).

him to bid on. On a club lead Fallenius wins the CJ then plays
on hearts and eventually emerges with 10 tricks. 1IMP to Senior,
down 41-31. Fallenius might be the answer to a trivia question
- "Which man has played for his country for the longest time
without residing in it?" Bjorn left Sweden for Manhattan 11 years

Fallenius wisely runs from 3H doubled to 4D. Erichsen, with extras
on defence, doubles and leads a trump, and now the defence have
three top winners and must try to get a fourth. But they cannot;
the problem is that if Erichsen leads a club to his partner,
he cannot play trumps anymore. But double-dummy the hand looks
cold anyway. When Erichsen fails to cash his side's club winners,
Fallenius makes ten tricks in a canter by pitching a club and
crossruffing. +510 and a huge 10 IMPs.

OR - With Sweden leading 51-31 Liggins launches another aggressive
preempt; at this vulnerability, anything goes is his motto. Sundelin
produces a cue-bid (spades and another) and Sylvan has enough
to bid slam on his own. On the heart lead Sylvan needs very little
- but he does not get it. He plays trumps from the top - of course
- and when the clubs do not split he has to lose two tricks now.
Unlucky, but what else can one do?

{
CR - Lindkvist's double-barreled action shows a weak-two with
extras. Senior comes in of course, to reach the good slam. On
Fallenius' diamond lead declarer has several extra chances -
they all boil down to not losing a trump trick as the cards lie.
One could construct reasons for finding the winning play - but
the entry constraints force you to take the trump view at trick
two. That is too big a position and Senior plays spades from
the top to go down at trick 13 when the heart loser does not
go away. This was unlucky for team Senior. Still 51-31 for Sweden.

{
OR - Sylvan resists the temptation to preempt but drives himself
to 2H anyway in the end. The defense can cash their four plain-suit
winners but have no guarantee of a trump trick. However declarer
does not make the effort to go for a trump coup and just leads
hearts from the top in the middle game when the 4-1 split shows
up, to settle for 110, on a very unexciting looking board at
this table. Still maybe N/S will compete more in the other room?

CR - Indeed, the Multi 2D gets Fallenius to declare 2S from the
3-card suit. He wins the diamond lead in dummy to play a spade
to the S10; had he won in hand and led a spade to dummy, he might
have overcome the unlucky trump break I think. As it is, three
trump and three plain suit losers means one down for a flat board.
Still Sweden by 51-31.

{
27 OR - The combination of aggressive positions by the Swedes
gets them to 3D with no aces and a lot of work to do in trumps.
Best defence might find a way to set the hand two tricks, but
in the middle game Liggins underleads his SA and that lets Sylvan
pitch his spade on the established hearts. The defence still
get a club ruff to set the hand. Mind you, since 2S was probably
going one down on most normal lines of defense, minus 50 is hardly
a triumph for E/W.

{
CR - Maybe this deal just naturally lends itself to aggression,
since the auction from the Open Room is duplicated here. On the
trump lead Fallenius makes a great play to put in the DJ, saving
his side a trick there. Erichsen wins in hand to lead the HK,
and Lindkvist cashes all his aces hoping for inspiration. Then
he settles back and waits for two trump tricks, for a slightly
sweaty flat board. Still Sweden 51-31.

{
OR - Liggins is tough to keep out of any auction; when Sundelin
preempts to 3H his response is to bid 3NT - beat me if you can!
on the good but normal top heart lead he takes the second round,
then plays DA and another. Sylvan shifts to a low spade, and
Liggins naturally misguesses, by playing the SQ. Now he needs
Sylvan to hold both the high spades to escape for down one. Is
that too much to ask? Liggins has preserved an entry to dummy
in the D6, to allow him to escape for -100. Sylvan could have
played for more on defence but just setting the game was enough.

{
CR - In the Closed Room Senior's preempt goads Lindkvist into
the same 3NT action and Senior avoids the heart lead now - selecting
instead the disastrous C8. Lindkvist plays the D5 (an inaccuracy,
the D8 is better) to the DQ and DA and covers the H10 with the
HJ. A heart continuation might still bother declarer, but a club
back gives declarer nine tricks when Erichsen wastes his second
high honor. A spectacular +600 for Sweden, and 12IMPs leaving
them up by 63-31.

OR - This auction may look strange but 2D is a heart raise -
N/S use 2C as a relay with other good hands. Liggins reaches
4H speedily, concealing everything from his opponents - generally
good strategy. The defence cash out and +620 for N/S looks a
normal result. [Time to tell you a little about E/W; P.O Sundelin
is to my mind one of the world's premier analysts and smartest
commentators. Fluent in English, his speed at the commentary
table is matched only by his 'thoughtfulness' as a player.]

CR - In this room 2C is a GF relay, and Lindkvist shows his moderate
hand with six hearts before Fallenius signs off in game (using
4D as a puppet to 4H?). Again the defence cash out and the play
takes no time. [This dull hand gives me a chance to fill you
in on Brian Senior, who is perhaps underrated as a player - his
journalist talents do not let him play as much as he might like.
He travels the world as a bulletin man, but as I recall has not
yet played for Britain, though he has numerous caps in the Home

OR - Sylvan and Sundelin have not been making enormous headway
this set so far, but they score a goal here when Fawcett's [nauseatingly
- BR] light opening blows up in his face. It precipitates E/W
to reaching 4H on 19HCP and persuades Liggins to make the opening
lead to let through the game. On a spade lead (the only other
sensible choice would be a trump - equally disastrous] Sylvan
takes his discard, draws trumps and claims +590. Those who live
by the sword....

CR - The difference in tempo on the two auctions is dramatic
-the opening side sell out to 3S, West perhaps fearing that 4S
may be laydown. But East takes three tricks on defense to hold
Fallenius to 140. To my mind a well-deserved swing for Sweden,
but they will take the 12IMPs whether they are merited or not
I suppose. Sweden now lead 75-31. So far Senior's squad have
gained only one swing on the set bar an overtrick IMP; Sweden
have been playing in form and in luck when the occasion demands
it!

since he wants a home for his club loser, and makes 140 without

{
CR - E/W have been having far the worst of it at this table,
which perhaps explains the 2D (weak both majors) action by Erichsen.
Senior is of course not interested in game; Fallenius cannot
bid spades now, so Senior gets to declare 2H on a trump lead.
Lindkvist ducks to ensure he gets three heart tricks later. If
Senior goes after clubs he emerges with six tricks, but he plays
spades, and the defense accurately play diamonds; a few agonizing
tricks later it is -150 and an exotic flat board. Still Sweden
75-31.

then naturally hops up with the DA (not best?) to play spades
- and Sundelin reciprocates by taking his HK prematurely to play
spades again. That gives declarer an overtrick in a position
where the defense were likely to prevail had East ducked his
HK.

CR Still, the Swedish team do not have to worry; Senior finds
a disastrous D10 lead against 1NT - but who could blame him?
That costs a trick and a tempo. Lindkvist guesses the hearts
in the middle-game to emerge with 120 as well, and a flat board.
A very nice set by Lindkvist-Fallenius, who have created a lot
of good positions against a pair who were not playing badly.
As a result with 16 boards to go Sweden lead 75-31, having held
their opponents to less than an IMP a board.
