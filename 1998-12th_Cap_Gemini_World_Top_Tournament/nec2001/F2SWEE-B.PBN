{
OR - In the Open Room Mohan and Lev play a Standard American
card with few gadgets. They are a newish partnership - formed
3 or so years ago with a fair amount of success in US National
events. Here Lev's 2NT is passed out and Lindkvist guesses wrong
when he leads the HJ not a low one (compare if the H9 and S9
switched hands to see why it might be right to do what he did).
Lev exits with the HK - and Lindkvist ducks - an interesting
shot, and a fine play, depriving declarer of a critical late
entry to dummy. Down two.

CR - The 2-way 1C opening (11-13/17+) gets Sylvan to 2S - higher
than he'd like. Pszczola leads the D7 [low from doubletons],
helping declarer take the finesse, and Sylvan exits with the
HK; Pszczola wins to play a second diamond. Sylvan could cash
the diamonds then ruff a heart, and play to force the defence
to give him 2 trump tricks - that works on the cards. But he
wins the second diamond in dummy and leads a spade up. If he
guesses to play the SJ he still has chances - his actual play
of a spade to the SK and a low spade dooms him to -50, 48-33.

OR - Here Lev simply drives to the 5-3 heart fit - his doubleton
club suggests hearts will be better than no-trumps, and so it
proves. But the 6-2 club split causes a problem. When Lindkvist
takes the HA (far better to duck since if he does Mohan might
play the HK next - wouldn't you?) and cashes the CK then plays
the CJ, Mohan thoughtfully ducks. But Fallenius overtakes the
CJ to play a third club, giving Mohan the idea of the 6-2 split.
He ruffs high and finesses the H9 to make the hand; well played,
but a defensive gem missed.

SK and a heart to the HK holds - well done Pszczola. Now if declarer
leads the HJ he is down - and he does! [Who can blame him though
- if hearts were 4-1 failing to do that would doom him. Also
he'd go down if the defence could force him to ruff a club with
the HJ]. The defence make no mistake now. North takes the HJ

overtake and lead a third club. Down one.

OR - Lev of course often regards the bidding as merely the prelude
to the play, Mohan takes a more aesthetic approach. Here though
Mohan views to treat his hand as balanced initially - then drives
to 6D when Lev shows the black suits and a slam try. 6D is poor
but far better than 6NT (I make it in the 25% range) since you
need to hold your diamond losers to one and to set up a spade
or find a rather unlikely squeeze (and if the defence lead clubs
that chance goes). Mohan plays diamonds from the top, down one.

CR - When Sylvan makes a positive (7/8+) response to the 2-way
club you'd have thought the Swedes would be in slam. Not so;
Sundelin takes a pessimistic approach to pass 3NT, knowing he
is facing a minimum and a misfit; but even so that is quite a
view! Well done. On a club lead Sundelin wins in hand to pass
the D9. That gives him 660 (he can't quite get the double-squeeze
going for 690). We have space to tell you a little about P-O
Sundelin, who has been a regular on the Swedish team for 30 years
now. 13IMPs to Sweden; 58-46 to e-bridge.

CR - A triumph for the E/W methods as Sylvan shows 17-20 balanced
and Sundelin transfers to hearts. There are only seven top tricks
on a club lead but North might get endplayed in hearts to open
spades? Whatever the case, on a spade lead the defence of taking
the SA and shifting to clubs would hold Sylvan to 110. But that
is far from obvious, and when Gawrys ducks trick one Sylvan sets
up diamonds for a club discard and that is 140 and 8IMPs. The
score is 58-54 to e-bridge.

to happen in spades or the club finesse - or some help from the
defense. With spades 3-3 3D crawls home with +110 - not such
a dull board here, I suppose. And 1IMP to e-bridge, up 59-54.

life harder for their opponents? [And now a chance for a word

your opponents reopen you from partscore bid game, if they reopen

major-suit cards. On the trump lead declarer can utilize the
CA, then take the diamond finesse. Now when it loses he needs
trumps to split and a little bit of luck in hearts. The 4-1 spade
split means he has to play for down one, and this time the cards

{
CR - In this room there are less inferences about the 1NT bid
promising values, so Pszczola makes to my mind the value bid
of 3S, and Gawrys looks at his major-suit cards and accepts happily.
Double-dummy on the club lead declarer can succeed if he guesses
to play for the DA offside. After the early play declarer must
use his two entries to dummy to ruff clubs, and then he can endplay
East with the fourth trump to lead diamonds. As I say, the line
Pszczola follows is more sensible - it just does not happen to
work. Flat board.

OR - Fallenius' intervention over the 15-17 no-trump is aggressive
but that is partnership style. Still, Lindkvist's dummy is a
spectacular disappointment and the defence is perfect. After
2 rounds of hearts Lev finds the club shift, then hops up with
the DA to cash 2 clubs. Back comes the third heart, and Fallenius
leads a spade to the SK. Now he needs to guess if spades are
3-3 or 4-2 with Mohan having the bare SA left. If he exits with
the SJ he holds his loss to 500, but he leads a low spade and
the defence win the S9 and lead a heart for -800. Ouch.

up a diamond trick but never gets his second club trick since
the finesse might risk the contract. as it happens given the
result from the other room the result from this table was essentially
irrelevant! 12IMPs to e-bridge, finally with some sort of lead
again; 71-57. Just out of curiosity; how many pairs would pass
the South cards vulnerable at Teams? My guess is that taking

Gawrys ruffs and at once misguesses spades - logical but unlucky.
The defense now carefully play diamonds at every opportunity,
and the hand goes wrong for Gawrys as he  loses two spades and
a ruff and eventually trump control. In fact embarrassingly Gawrys
loses 4 spade tricks (count them) for -50. 4IMPs to Sweden, and

double of 2S is take-out, and Lindkvist retreats to 3H, showing
a minimum - he seems to have too much in hearts to defend, but
2S would have been bloody (at least two down). 3H is one down
in top tricks on Mohan's heart lead, since the defence have four
black suit winners. They might also get their diamond trick if
Lev leads the suit twice -that is a bit tough though. After the

remaining true to his cautious roots) Sylvan leads a diamond
for a relatively painless +200. I guess you could say that this
3IMPs was earned, but maybe there might also be a message that
if you open 11-counts like this you deserve to go minus... 71-64

- I am surprised that he made no attempt to bid out his hand
pattern. And facing a 14-16 no-trump why should slam have any
play at all? Not to worry; Lindkvist produces virtually no wasted
values and card-perfect diamond and spade holdings. Mohan's HA
lead looks slightly naive to me - I wonder how Lev describes
it? As it is with only 11 top tricks and the club finesse wrong
the play might not have gone that quickly on a club lead. But
after this start the HK is the 12th trick; 1430 for Sweden.

12-14 balanced with four spades, then after a relay he gets to
cuebid in diamonds, and that is enough for Gawrys to jump to
slam. Played by South life is easier - declarer can draw trumps
then set up diamonds and hope to find the DQ or if not, that
the CK is onside. Today diamonds come in, and that is a flat
board - but e-bridge might have dodged a bullet (consider if
the East had Qxxx of diamonds instead of four small, then the
HA lead would have cost the contract). 71-64 e-bridge.
