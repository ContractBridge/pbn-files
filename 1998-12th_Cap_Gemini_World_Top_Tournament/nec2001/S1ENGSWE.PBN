{
OR - Time for a battle between two experienced teams. Per-Olof
Sundelin and Johan Sylvan, for Sweden, have formed a succesful
partnership for many years, and so have England's Glyn Liggins
and Joe Fawcett. They start well by reaching par on the first
board. With clubs 2-2 and the heart honors onside, 4S is an easy
make, so when Sundelin showed a limited opening hand (11-16 HCP)
with lots of diamonds, and Sylvan didn't fancy his chances on
defense, 5D doubled was two down. Minus 300.

{
CR - After playing with other partners for ten years, Magnus
Lindkvist and Björn Fallenius have resumed their partnership
from the late 80's. Here, they will take on a newly founded Norwegian-British
combination. And once again East/West save in 5D. Fallenius would
surely have bid 4S over a lower diamond bid from Senior, but
5D was too high. Minus 300, a push. [Your host for this session:

{
OR - Opposite a 1S opening showing 11-16, the practical approach
is to simply bid 4S, but Sylvan responded 2NT (game-force, 4+
spades), just in case there was a perfect fit. Sundelin's 3C
showed a minimum, so 4S was high enough. On the club lead, Sundelin
won in hand to lead a low spade towards dummy, catering to all
4-0 breaks. Then he just knocked out the red aces for his contract.

{
CR - If a seven loser hand with four trumps isn't enough for
game opposite an opening bid showing five or more cards, it looks
like East/West open very light indeed. And if they do, maybe
Senior was worth 4S, in spite of his doubtful values in the red
suits. On the club lead, Senior banged down the SA and lost his
overtrick. Plus 140. First blood to Sweden, leading 7-0.

OR - Most bidding systems are rigid when it comes to balanced
opening hands. Sylvan's hand fell into his system's 14-16 range,
so he looked no further, in spite of his empty majors. Sundelin
had the decency to deliver solid stoppers in both majors, so
it didn't matter which hand was declarer, and after the HQ opening
lead Sylvan could immediately claim ten tricks. Plus 630.

Another plus 630. Sweden still leading 7-0. In spite of the uneventful
result, I'm convinced that it is wrong to open 1NT with a hand
such as West's. Why not 1D followed by 2C? Is that too old-fashioned?

OR - Sylvan's 1C showed either a balanced 11-13 or any 17+, and
Sundelin's double was for take-out. And that was enough to scare
North/South from their cold vulnerable game, at IMPs. Personally,
I don't understand why people pre-empt when there's a good chance
that their side can make a game. On Sundelin's diamond lead Liggins
could take twelve tricks, but only managed eleven. Plus 200.

OR - East/West has most of the strength, but the hand belongs
to North/South, who can make 4D. But it's unlikely that they
are willing to go so high, so if East/West competes to 3H they
surely will buy the contract. Sylvan's 1NT showed clubs, but
over 2D Sundelin had no take-out double available (otherwise,
it would be a perfect description of his hand), and Sylvan gave
up because of his spade singleton, so Liggins was left to play
a cozy partscore. Plus 130.

bid all by himself. What a contrast to East's passive attitude
at the other table! Erichsen was almost worth 4H, but when Senior
had two diamonds and the CK was offside, 3H was enough. Plus

OR - A cold grand slam on only 32 HCP. But if one of North's
clubs had been a heart, or one of South's hearts a club, twelve
tricks would have been the limit. Did Liggins and Fawcett knew
what they were doing? Ater the trump queen ask, they embarked
on a king asking series of bids. By the time they reached 6S,
Liggins knew that Fawcett had no king, so he gambled that his
partner would have a queen and shape for his strong bidding.

was doubled for penalties, Liggins removed to 1S. That would

course. After a spade lead the defense tried to create a trump
promotion, but since the bidding suggested Liggins was 5-4-2-2,
Sylvan got it right by ruffing high and dropping the DJ. Plus

make it if they guess to play on clubs first.

OR - Everybody plays 3NT on this deal, but after a spade lead
there is only one way to make it legitimately: duck the SA twice,
lead a low club and later finesse in diamonds, not in hearts.
But who plays like that? When Fawcett started clubs with the
ace, the 4-0 split doomed the contract. No it didn't. On the
second club round Sundelin won the king (an error: South has
three spades and four clubs, so ducking the CK twice is safe
even if Sylvan has the HA). Later, Fawcett trusted Sylvan's heart
signal and took the right finesse. A great plus 400.

also cashed the CA and Senior didn't make a mistake. In the end,

with the SK. If Erichsen ducks, Lindkvist establishes his seventh

{
CR - Here, where Senior bid at the three-level just because his
side had nine trumps, Lindkvist could have earned his side 7
easy IMPs by passing. Instead, he counted his points and thought
3NT could be a good contract. How wrong! He bought an ace and
found clubs 3-3, and yet 3NT was still two down off the top.
No, it wasn't. Erichsen thought Lindkvist had to have a long
suit, so he played Senior for queen third of diamond. Thank you,
Norway! An unlikely plus 600 gave Sweden 13 IMPs and the lead
in the match, 25-20.

OR - Sylvan's 1C was either 11-13 balanced or any 17+, and since
the first type is the most frequent, Sundelin may have given
up over 2S. When he doubled for take-out instead, Sylvan was
left to play 2NT. Since the CQ is an entry, a spade lead is best,
but Liggins' heart lead looks reasonable, even though it only
led to one down. Minus 50.

CR - Lindkvist's Multi 2D opening (usually a weak two-bid in
any major) led to Fallenius' declaring 2S from the short side.
The HA was onside and spades were 3-3, so eight tricks were always
there. Plus 110. 2 more IMPs to Sweden, now leading 27-20.

{
OR - If it's OK to open on weak 4-4-4-1 hands, like North's,
it can't be right to respond 2NT on South's. Not only because
of the strength, but also because it risks playing a notrump
contract from the wrong side. Fawcett couldn't do much more than
knock out the DA and hope to catch Sundelin in an endplay, but
the defenders failed to cooperate. Minus 100.

{
CR - 1D showed 11-16 with real diamonds in an unbalanced hand,
and 1S was a transfer to 1NT. Fallenius' follow-up with 3D looks
good to me, since Lindkvist usually has five diamonds, but opposite
the dreaded 4-4-4-1 they were overboard. On the HK lead it's
best to duck, but Erichsen was allowed to ruff away the HA. If
he continues with DA, diamond, East/West get a second undertrick,
but on his spade return, Lindkvist ruffed two spades in dummy
for one down. Minus 100, a push. Sweden still leading, 27-20.

OR - All East/West has to do to defeat 1NT is play a club from
East. Sundelin didn't find it on the go, of course, but when
he won the SA he duly led one, restriciting Liggins to six tricks.
Minus 100. But wait! Sundelin ducked the SA once, so Liggins
would have made his contract if he had played HA, heart enplaying
Sylvan (not easy to find, though).

OR - Sylvan could open 1NT (14-16) or 1S (11-16) but chose to
upgrade his hand to a two-way 1C instead (11-13 balanced or 17+).
Sundelin's double was for take-out, and Sylvan took a shot at
game. On the DJ lead, Fawcett played low, and when he later forgot
to cash his ace he never made it. Plus 450. But if Fawcett wins
the opening lead and returns a heart, Liggins cooperating by
ducking, and Sylvan leads a spade to the ace or the jack, down
he goes (the winning line is to lead the SQ - not easy).

CR - When Erichsen opened 1NT (15-17) in spite of his five-card
major, and Senior chose not to investigate a spade fit, Lindkvist
had the chance to shine by leading a diamond. But when he did
what most people would, Erichsen had a safe line for nine tricks
(cash the SA). Instead he led to the CK and finessed in spades.
The 4-0 split meant he would have gone down if Fallenius returned
a diamond and the DA is with North. A lucky plus 430. 1 more
IMP to Sweden, leading 33-20.

lead. Here Fallenius led a club, which looked like it gave away
a trick. The spade break meant declarer couldn't profit from
it, so when Senior later played a club to the ten he was playing
with fire. He couldn't gain anything if it worked, and had it
lost to the singleton queen he may have gone down. Now it was
