{
OR - Fireworks on Board 1. Pszczola's 2D over the 14-16 1NT was
D+a major and 4C showed hearts. Pszczola bid his spades enroute
to 5D but Gawrys was happy in 4S and Justin judged, theoretically
correctly, to double and defend. In theory, any lead beats 4S
by a trick, but a heart would have made the defence easier and
declarer would have to play carefully to keep control. After
a club to the king declarer led a trump. Justin must rise now
and play a heart. When he played low, there were no further chances
for the defence. 4S doubled made; EW plus 590.

{
CR - The bidding was equally brisk here, but this time it was
South who effectively had to decide whether to defend 4S or press
on to 5H. That was not even close for Mohan, who held no defensive
values and two more hearts than he might have for the auction
so far. Hackett cashed his top diamonds and can hardly be blamed
for not underleading his CA at Trick 3. Failure to do so killed
the club ruff but 5H was still two down; minus 300. First blood
to e-bridge, 7-0. (your host for this segment Marc Smith)

{
OR - The Poles reached a grand slam that is poorer than the required
odds. Over the strong NT Gawrys simply asked for aces. Pszczola
showed 0/3 and 5D was to play opposite zero. Pszczola raised
to show 3 aces and Gawrys gave himself a seventh. Declarer must
guess the hearts and Gawrys did so by means of a show-up squeeze.
He isolated the club menace with North so that when he played
the second heart at Trick 12 he knew Justin's last card was a
club. He therefore rose with the HA, dropping Jason's doubleton
HQ. 7D made; EW plus 1440.

CR - The auction here was even more straightforward - Over Hackett's
strong NT, Mavromichalis transfered to diamonds with 3C and then
simply jumped to 6D. Hackett didn't play the hand - he claimed
12 or 13 tricks depending on the heart finesse. When South had
the HQ that was 6D just made; EW plus 920. Another 11 IMPs to
e-bridge; ahead 18-0 after just two deals.

OR - Jason upgraded the South hand to a 2NT opening bid. Justin
asked for 5-card majors and, finding none, chose the 9-trick
game rather than looking for a 4-4 fit. An unlikely HQ lead might
have made declarer sweat a bit more, but a diamond looks normal.
Jason ducked the DK, won the second round, crossed to a spade
and played a club. When Pszczola rose with the ace to clear the
diamonds, declarer could claim 11 tricks when the CJ fell; NS
plus 660.

{
OR - Jason tranferred to spades and then made an auto-splinter
jump to 4C, agreeing his own suit. With only a doubleton spade,
no aces and half of his hand wasted in clubs, Justin had an easy
sign off. Quite right too, as slam needs both a 3-2 spade break
and something good to happen in the minors. Declarer won the
heart lead, cashed his top trumps and led a club. When Gawrys
took his ace, Justin claimed 11 tricks; NS plus 650

[Declarer "N"]
{
CR - The auction began the same way here, and the likely explanation
for North's 4D bid is that he thought 4C was self-agreeing RKCB
for spades and he therefore responded to show 1/4 key cards.
The subsequent auction suggests that Mohan thought 4C was an
auto-splinter and 4NT RKCB, with 5C showing one key card. Opposite
the earlier diamond cue-bid, his jump to slam seems like a fair
bet. On a different day, 6S might have made, but the 4-1 trump
break quickly put paid to that: one down; NS -100. 13 IMPs to
HACKETT - on the board: 13-18.

OR - Jason's 1H opening may look strange to US readers but 1H/1S
are the normal opening bid on weak notrump hands in their methods.
The contract is not great, but with all suits breaking evenly
and a friendly diamond switch from West early in the play, Jason
soon had eight tricks; NS plus 120.

That was good enough for him, and he settle for 3NT. With spades
3-3, the defence has no suit worth attacking. Jason started with
a diamond and declarer continued the suit. The heart switch set
up two defensive tricks in that suit but declarer could afford
to give up a trick to the CQ to establish his nine tricks. EW

CR - Hackett opened a Strong/artificial 1C, heard a natural and
positive response, and bid 2NT. 2H seems more normal, as 2NT
risks attracting a raise when partner has two low spades and
QJx of hearts in a 2-3-3-5 shape. On the other hand, 2NT gave
Hackett the maximum chance of becoming declarer! It also encouraged
the defenders to start with three rounds of hearts, setting up
three tricks in the suit for declarer. No need to concede a club
now - 10 tricks; EW plus 630. 1 IMP to Hackett, closing to 14-18.

OR - We see another illustration of the ultra-aggressive style
of the twins here, as they each bid 1-level higher than their
counterpart at the other table. I doubt that you'd find either
the 2D or the 4D bid in any textbook, particularly vulnerable,
but it sure makes life tough for the opponents. 4D would have
been 800 or 1100 here but how can West possibly do anything except
bid 4H? East had enough to advance this time, but it's easy to
construct layouts on which he would not when 6H would be easy
(SA, CK-J, 2-1 in the red suits). 6NT made; EW plus 1440.

had nothing to spare and, indeed, even 3S is hardly cold. But
Jason played double dummy, guessing both pointed suits and scoring
an unlikely 11 tricks when Gawrys did not cash his CA when he

no more than the spade finesse with extra chances (a diamond
lead, or a heart away from the king). With the spade king onside,
the lead was irrelevant. EW plus 1440.

CR - Mavromachalis did not evaluate her hand as highly as Gawrys.
Facing the same 15-17 1NT opening, she transfered to spades and
raised to game. When LEv failed to appreciate the defensive power
of his 7-6-5-4 of diamonds, Hacket scored up an overtrick to
save an IMP. EW plus 710. 12 IMPs to e-bridge, extending their
lead to 30-17.

OR - Both East-West pairs scored 3NT despite five top losers.
Here, Jason had no real chance to do the right thing. After an
uninformative auction, Justin had a blind lead and, not unreasonably,
chose his 4-card major. Gawrys made the correct technical play
by putting up the queen and Jason won with the ace. Can you see
a reason why he should not return a spade? Since Justin could
easily have KJxx r K10xx, nor do I. That was 12 tricks; EW plus
490.

{
CR - After the same auction, Lev also led a spade. Mavromichalis
tried hard to deflect Mohan from the losing spade return by falscarding
with the king from her hand! Now Mohan knew that his side could
not cash spade but he perhaps assumed that declarer was attempting
to deflect him from the spade continutation because it was the
CA she was missing. So, he fell for the double bluff and returned
a spade anyway. Declarer forgot to cash her fifth club, so made
only 11 tricks: 1 IMP to e-bridge when it could have been so
many more. e-bridge lead 31-17.

punished but seldom is. Against 2D doubled, Jason led a trump,
blowing the defenders' likely second trick in that suit but ensuring
a third club winner instead. With a trick in each major also
to be lost, that was 2D doubled minus two; EW minus 300.

CR - Papa Hackett avoided the overcall and Mohan-Lev bid aggresively
to 3NT with 12 facing 11. Declarer won the CQ, finessed in each
major, and conceded a heart. With hearts 3-3, it looked like
the thin game would come home for a 7-IMP gain, but Hackett found
a way to give declarer a guess - a low diamond - and Lev inevitable
failed to divine the winning play. The D10 effectively forced
the ace and now when Hackett got in with the third round of hearts
he had three diamond winners to cash. 3NT down one; NS minus
100. 9 IMPs to HACKETT, back in it at 26-31.

OR - Pszczola opened 1H and then doubled 2S for takeout. Gawrys
judged to play the 5-2 heart fit and Jason led his diamond. Justin
won the ace but played a club instead of delivering his brother's
ruff. Declarer picked up trumps and subsequently conceded two
more club tricks: nine tricks; EW plus 140. Had Justin give the
diamond ruff at Trick 2, declarer could still have succeeded.
He wins the spade return, draws trumps, and cashes his third
diamond winner, squeezing South out of either a club stopper
or an exit card. Declarer must then score a second club.

the one and two-level. Hackett opened a Strong 1C and Mavromichalis
doubled to show a semi-positive. When Hacket then had to bid
at the 3-level to show his suit, West was left with no idea whether
or not to raise. She did and game proved to be far too high.
In fact, the defenders managed to get a minor-suit crossruff
going with the result that declarer went three down; EW minus
300. 10 IMPs from nowhere to e-bridge, ahead now by 41-26.

OR - EW have a choice of 5-3 minor-suit fits while NS have two
4-4 major-suit fits. Neither NS pairs made more than a brief
foray into the auction - with his DK under the bidder, it is
understandable why Jason thought 2H would be pushing it just
a bit too far. By the time he got another chance, EW were on
their way to game. In fact, 3NT by West is unbetable, so Gawrys's
decision to look for a diamond game bypassing 3NT was a losing
one. Pszczola at least ensured a plus score by passing the invitation;
4D just made; EW plus 130.

ambitions, so when Pszczola entered the fray with 4S he had an
easy discouraging double, and Justin judged well to pass despite
his huge heart fit. With both black suits lying very favorably
for declarer, he could not be stopped from scoring 6S, 2C and

a game swing when Mavromichalis decided she did not have enough
