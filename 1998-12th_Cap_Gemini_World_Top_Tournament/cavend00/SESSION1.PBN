{
If you wander into 7S, you will make it and score heavily. This
is likely to happen if South starts with a strong 2S over 1D.
North will soon use Blackwood. If South shows his void (5NT),
North might not bother about the SQ. After "only" 1S, the 4th
suit auctions may focus too much on the minors and both level
and strain will be problematic. Deutsch did jump shift and the
auction followed predictable lines

is likely to push E/W to 3C. Here Weinstein's 1C was raised to
2C (constructive) but there was no reason for West to look for

An unexpected auction. Levin's 4-6 Flannery created a strained
series of bids. Hamman was forced to treat his hand as a diamond
one-suiter, leading to 3NT which might have made. When Weinstein
belatedly introduced his clubs, he did not reckon on Levin returning
to hearts where they rested, doubled and down 800. [There must
be something wrong with a method that does not permit you to
play in your eight-card trump suit (SRK).] DA, DQ to K, HQ from
Zia, club, club ruffed, heart. Declarer lost 3 spades.

Surrealistic Pillow. Helgemo's responsive double with great defense
and mediocre offense, was very risky. This does not explain Chagas'
3S where both 3D and 3C would seem more normal. (He assumed that
Helgemo would have 4S -- the product of an unfamiliar partnership.)
Worse, when Helgemo assumed the 5th spade, he bid on rather than
double, turning +500 into -400. To say no double, no trouble,
would be an understatement

{
Chagas/Helgemo brushed aside Levy's strong NT overcall to reach
a normal, slightly pushy, 4S contract. Chemla's club lead, although
it set up a second club trick, left Chagas with an entry problem.
Chagas overtook the club queen to finesse in trumps, and later
had to guess the doubleton DJ. Levy counted out for 3-2-2-6 and
Chagas thought he would not have overcalled NT with Ax of diamonds.
 Great result.

finesse the CQ and cash the DA. +980.

Great scope for variation. Should East keep 1H alive? We say
yes. Will West try for game? Yes, if hearts are raised. However,
if East starts with a semi-forcing 1NT and gives preference,
N/S may compete and finish in 2 or 3 spades. 3H has no chance,
and even 2H requires some play. N/S stand to take 8 tricks in
spades with careful play...Casen did not reopen against 2H. D10
to A, trump switch, Q, CJ. Now declarer can take the ruffing
finesse against the CA and lose only five tricks. +110. For N/S
to enter the auction, North must protect with 2S. Is this realistic?

If North boosts South's weak 2S to 3, he may silence his opponents.
If he passes instead, East will reopen with a double and West

probably fail when declarer misguesses the diamonds. Is it better,
then, to have loved and lost? When Cohen passed 2S, Lindkvist
eschewed the normal takeout double in favor of 3D. He then passed
his partner's 3H. This was high enough as he lost two spades,
a club, a diamond and a trump.

E/W will coast into 4S which is likely to fail if North has opened
1C and South leads the suit. If North opens 1D, however, the
DJ opening lead will give declarer the contract. South might,
with reason, lead a trump. Cohen's nebulous 1D was discounted
by Berkowitz who led a heart -- the only suit legitimately bid
by his partnership. Pity. +620.

{
If North opens 1NT, he will usually buy the contract. Range may
be an issue. Should North start with one of a minor, East may
step in with 1S, after which East may declare 2S.  Berkowitz,
steaming after the previous deal, raised a 14-16 NT to game.
Lindkvist led a spade, but cashed the DA and allowed Cohen to
escape for one down. Of such victories, losers are made.

Hampson's 7D bid was optimistic to a degree. He really could
not expect his partner to have the two top hearts on the bidding.
Had he settled for 6D, however, it is likely that Abecassis would
have saved in 7C for down 800. Alas, the heart finesse lost.
There was joy in France.

The tale of the DJ. The French conducted a pretty auction (Abk6's
5NT showing 2 key cards and a spade void), although South's 7D
strikes us as somewhat mysterious. 7H can be made by ruffing
two spades in South and discarding four clubs from the North
hand on South's diamonds. A dummy reversal of sorts. We are aware
that a director was called, relating to the 7D bid

Although an aggressive North might overcall 2D and then double
4H for takeout, the normal action is to sell out to 4H. Just
as well, as 4H is routinely defeated on a diamond lead and spade
switch, while 4S, the issue of a takeout double, would be down
500.

{
E/W will reach 2S around a Negative Double by South. If they
are left to play, the defense can give declarer a tough ride
by threatening a trump promotion in diamonds. Declarer can make
2S by guessing hearts, and later guessing to ruff the 4th diamond
high. If South aggressively doubles again, North will declare
3C, where he will surely fail. Mansell's 3D strikes us as unilateral,
but 3D does not play so much worse than 3C, down two, -100.
