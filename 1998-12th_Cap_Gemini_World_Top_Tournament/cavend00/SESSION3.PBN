{
Age old question: double or overcall? 4S is cold. Even heart
ruff doesn't help (stops the overtrick). Weinstein preferred
to overcall, and DeWijs' 2NT was artificial, at least a limit
raise. DK led; drew trumps, HK to A, returned heart so diamond
went on a heart for +450.

After winning the CQ, North should duck a diamond. Indeed, that

over 1D? That's a style issue. A light offshape double might
push N/S to 2D, which is touch and go, but makeable.

RSW: If  South opens a risky vulnerable 2S and North raises to

West to jump to 6D making. SRK: However, should North raise pre-emptively
to 4S, East is up against it. 4NT (2-suit takeout) would work
well, but a direct 5C.... EOK: When Hamilton did not open 2S,
Bates/Larsen could have tried 6D over 4D, but settled for a heart

{
With a trump break required for starters, and clear handling
charges, 6H is plenty. 7H can be made on a spade/diamond squeeze.
The alternative line of ruffing two spades in dummy will fail
with a club lead. Bates' 1S overcall (the previous hand surely
having an influence) created a RKC scenario ending at 7H. Lovely?
Ping Pong. Spade to the queen and ace. Hamilton, fearing bad
breaks, drew lots of trumps. Larsen discarded a spade on the
4th round of trumps, and Bates now could not protect all the
suits.

A pushy 23 point game that succeeds on the diamond division.
One way, using inverted minor raises, to reach 3NT: 1D - 2D -
2NT - 3NT. Assuming, of course, E/W leave you alone. West is
likely to double 2D, and now it's not so easy to reach 3NT, or
to make it (misguess in diamonds now).  Larsen did well, in a
way, not to bid. Eisenberg's 3D catered to right-siding 3NT and
also to stopping safely.

{
If West opens 1S or 2S (S+m), E/W will have to judge well to
stop at 4S, which is in danger on a heart force. Gawrys played
4S by ruffing the heart and passing the SJ. Then 3 high clubs,
North ruffing. Gawrys ruffed the H return, led to the SA, and
played on clubs, North discarding a H&D. Then a H ruff and the
DA for an elegant 10 tricks. More than a decade ago M Lindkvist
(playing with Fallenius) incurred the largest penalty in World
Championship history (-3400). Deja voodoo. On this deal at another
table, he and Fredin went 7 down redoubled in 6S for the same
-3400. More expensive here!

{
If N/S reach the lucky diamond slam, E/W have an 1100 point save
in 6S. Although West would prefer to take his chances on defense.
In the actual event, spades were lost after East's 2H bid; and
the overcall had an effect on the play, too. When declarer broached
trumps, he eschewed the percentage play and went to the DK, one
down for a big swing to Cohen/Berkowitz.

If West forces with 2S over 1D, E/W will surely reach 6D. After
1D-1S 3D-3S 3NT, West has a difficult problem; 4D should get
him to slam--witness Bocchi -Duboin's auction. Jacobs did well
not to lead the HA; Bocchi won  CA; SA, S ruff, DA, S ruff with
the D10, DK, DQ, C2--we don't know whether Bocchi intended to
finesse the C10 to ruff out S, but Jacobs magnificently inserted
the CJ to foil that. Now Bocchi had to rely on the HA being right.
Bravo Mr. Auctioneer!

{
Another slam, this time a grand in either black suit (spades
requires a finesse). Smarting from their defeat on the previous
board, would the Ace Italian pair ascend the heights? No! After
a Stayman sequence located the spade fit, East jumped to 6. Taking
no chances, declarer won the diamond opening with the ace and
claimed 12 tricks.

Duboin was able to show his hand with a two-step sequence (1D

{
We wouldn't double 1S for takeout, but some experts would swear
by such actions. Double will lead to 4C, which might well make
on a S lead. If South passes, North might not bid over 2S and
South might sell out.Abecassis risked a double of 1S, then boldly
competed to 4C (note Quantin's gentle 3C). Garner followed 8-7
to the HA/K, so a third H established a discard for a spade.
Quantin guessed trumps for +130.

There is no ninth trick in 3NT, so les Francais did rather well
in theory to stop in 2D, Quantin bidding very conservatively.
3NT might make by North on a club to the ten and king. Bet it
happened often.
