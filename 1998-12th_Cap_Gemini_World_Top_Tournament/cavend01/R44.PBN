{
Three more boards to go, and we will end with three Norwegian
players at the same table. One of them, super star Geir Helgemo,
is partnering Sam Lev, USA, and are in second place after four
sessions; while the other two, Boye Brogeland and Espen Erichsen,
are lying third, only 2 points behind. Helgemo/Lev have gained
408 IMPs in the session so far, while Brogeland/Erichsen have
only gained 20 IMPs, so the gap has widened.

{
Upgrading his singleton king to full value, Erichsen opens a
four-card 1H and catches a forcing raise. Over 4H, Helgemo can't
resist bidding 4S, in spite of his excellent defense. It looks
like he's booked for at least two down, but when Brogeland crashes
his partner's CK at trick one and returns a low club, suit preference
for diamonds, Helgemo gets it right by going up ace. Oh, how
he wished he had the D8 in his own hand, but he doesn't, so in
the end Erichsen takes the setting trick. Minus 200.

{
If it's the last board of the tournament and you are in need
of points, would you have doubled 3NT on the North hand? Maybe
not, but Lev did, perhaps expecting his young opponents to have
overbid or just to cloud the issue. Had Helgemo's spades been
slightly stronger, it could have been a success, but now it only
meant minus 550 instead of minus 400.
