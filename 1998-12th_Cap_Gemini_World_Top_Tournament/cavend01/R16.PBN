{
Our featured stars for the next three rounds are Zia Mahmood/Billy
Eisenberg, who have started very badly in the 2001 Cavendish.
Raise what might be (and was) a 15-HCP notrump to game on a square
9 HCP, not vulnerable? I wouldn't advise it unless your partner
is Zia, who can pull a rabbit out of a hat ... but Billy Eisenberg's
partner WAS Zia.

{
 Boyd judged well to jump to 4S in reply Steve Robinson's three-level
negative double, with his singleton heart, "pure" values, and
strong spades. Boyd also judged well in the play, attacking clubs
early to set up slow tricks and kill North's entry before drawing
trumps. Zia shifted to the DK late in the play to kill declarer's
DA entry to the clubs (which had been blocked). However, the
third round of diamonds squeezed Eisenberg in hearts and clubs,
so West made an overtrick in 4S spades after all: minus 650 for
Zia/Eisenberg, a 73-IMP loss.

{
 Somewhere the wheels came off the North-South auction. Should
North, who could not bid 3D with a jump, try 4D over West's 2H?
Should South, who had only a shaded one-notrump response, bid
a second time because he had the "right" (sub-) minimum (a fit
for diamonds, a useful jack, an outside ace, and two spades where
he might have had only one)?
