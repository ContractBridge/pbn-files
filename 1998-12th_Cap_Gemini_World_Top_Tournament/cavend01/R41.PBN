{
Another top encounter. Geir Helgemo, of Norway and Sam Lev, of
USA, lying second after four sessions, are now facing four-placed
Italians Giorgio Duboin and Guido Ferraro. The difference between
the pairs was only 160 IMPs before the session started, but so
far Helgemo/Lev have won 132 IMPs, while Duboin/Ferraro have
lost 148 IMPs, so the actual difference is 440 IMPs.

{
How often do you have a four loser hand, get a raise in your
major and quit at the 2-level? Here, Ferraro did just that. And
right he was. But he had an auction to consider, and Lev's strong
1NT overcall scared him. It would have scared me, too. His lack
of intermediates in both spades and diamonds were warning signs,
and even if he knew he could be wrong, passing surely was the
percentage action.
