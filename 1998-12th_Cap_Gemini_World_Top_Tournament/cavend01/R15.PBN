{
There were opportunities for both sides in this auction. West
might have stolen the pot with an old-fashioned sound 3S opening
on adverse vulnerability. South might have shut West out by raising
two hearts straight to four (but who could think he should?),
or nailed four spades for 500 (but how could he expect to?).
Who could tell who's saving against whom?

[Declarer "W"]
{
 Alfredo Versace's 2C was natural and forcing after Valerio Guibilo's
prepared 1C opening. 2D suggested a balanced minimum and Versace
simplified the auction with a jump to 3NT. Gitelman led his partner's
suit, and declarer could not afford to duck South's HJ and risk
a spade shift. Moss shifted to the SJ after declarer drove out
the DA, but declarer had nine easy tricks to make 3NT. Minus
400 for Gitelman/Moss: no IMPs won or lost on this very flat
board.

{
As on Board 13, Gitelman risked a 1S overcall on a mediocre suit
in a live auction to get his side into the auction quickly. This
time Moss had a comfortable raise to two with good three-card
support. West's very pushy competitive double (played as takeout)
caught East with a heart fit. With balanced hands, North and
South could neither bid 3S nor double 3H.
