[Your host for Boards 1-12 is Danny Kleinman.] We will be following
Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss for the first three boards. A "fourth
suit artificial and forcing to game" (by agreement) sequence

{
Vul against not and in the dangerous sandwich position, North,
John Mohan, stayed out of the auction initially. Then, after
doubling West's "New Minor Forcing" two clubs for a lead, Mohan,
the apostle of balancing, doubled two diamonds for takeout. East,
whose two diamonds had not promised a strong suit, raised himself
to three diamonds preemptively, so South could not find the "profitable"
(minus 100 if not doubled) three-club save.

{
Undeterred by East's weak raise to two hearts over the intervening
double, West bid three clubs, ostensibly a game try, and when
East raised clubs, took a vulnerable five-club save against the
non-vulnerable four spades into which they pushed the opponents.
