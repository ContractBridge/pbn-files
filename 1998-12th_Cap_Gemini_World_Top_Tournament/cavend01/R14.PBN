{
[Your host for Boards 13-27 is Danny Kleinman.] After a routine
start to the auction, Gitelman entered with a marginal 1S. As
2H suggested four-card sipport, Moss had reason to believe the
N/S hands would fit well, so he made the well-reasoned decision
to raise on king-doubleton. Curtis Cheek, West, was not quite
strong enough to double.

{
 A routine passout for the players at this table and all standard
bidders: no score, but -23 IMPs for Gitelman/Moss. The HCP are
divided equally, but North-South have the majority of tens and
nines and the only hand that is not completely square. The hand
belongs to North-South. Souths playing either (9)10-12 or 11-14
notrumps would open 1NT, play there, and make it.

{
Gitelman was not tempted to go beyond game after Moss replied
to the artificial balanced forcing raise with a discouraging,
balanced rebid. Cheek found an effective diamond lead, which
Moss correctly let ride to Billy Miller's jack. Miller's club
switch set up a discard for dummy's DQ, so the defenders could
get only one trick each in clubs, diamonds and spades. Making
four, plus 620 for +36 IMPs.
