{
[Your host for this and the rest of the evening's boards is Danny
Kleinman.] Bridge experts divide into two camps with hands like
East's. Explorers rebid three hearts to seek the best game. Blasters
rebid four spades, maximizing their chances of making when they're
destined to reach four spades eventually anyhow.

{
West's feathery four-card overcall combined with East's double
of North's "limit raise or better" cue bid gave South a chance
to avoid the bad game. The scheme "pass = minimum, two notrump
= maximum weak notrump, three notrump = more" would let South
show his hand with a two-notrump rebid, but South jumped to three
notrump anyhow.

{
I've seen some wild bidders, relying religiously on the "Law
of Total Tricks," preempt with hands like North's. Though a jump
to four spades might goad East into a failing five clubs, Garner
judged wisely to bid a simple two spades; the downside of four
spades was a possible minus 500 via a takeout double and penalty
pass on certain layouts.
