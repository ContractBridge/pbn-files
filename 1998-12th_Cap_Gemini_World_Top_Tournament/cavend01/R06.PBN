{
 For this round the 2000 Cavendish winners, Marty Fleisher/Eric
Rodwell, face Kit Woolsey/Fred Stewart, playing a form of Precision.
The round starts with a comfortable partscore for E/W. A heart
lead would have been best for the defense, but Woolsey leads
a spade, of course, and now Fleisher has a late spade entry to
dummy. And when he establishes his diamonds, he at the same time
knocks out Woolsey's entry to the spades. Nine easy tricks, for
plus 150. 11 IMPs to Fleisher/Rodwell.

{
East/West are cold for 4H, but North/South have a cheap save
in 5D, and when Woolsey shows his support for Stewart's long
suit, the par contract is reached. However, when Fleisher doesn't
double, Rodwell knows that 5D won't be expensive and takes the
push. If there weren't a club ruff out or if the defenders were
not up to finding it, 5H would normally be made (North's 2S opening
shows at least five spades, at least four cards in a minor, and
once South shows up with three hearts, it's easy to play North
for club length).

{
 Woolsey's dangerous-looking takeout double, vulnerable opposite
a passed partner, could easily have cost 800 or more on a bad
day, and even here, where Stewart has some bits and pieces, they
are destined to lose at least 200 in 1NT their way if left to
themselves. However, Rodwell sticks in a lead-directing 1H, and
North/South are off the hook. Stewart plays the DQ to the first
trick, to show the jack, reasonably enough, but when Woolsey
continues with the DK, Stewart unblocks the jack, playing Woolsey
for AK10 fourth or fifth.
