{
This round Helgemo and Lev, the pair we are following, are still
East-West. A bit on the heavy side for a simple two heart overcall,
West started with a takeout double, then jumped to four hearts
in reply to East's responsive double of North's spade raise.

{
East's three-club jump showed a sound 4-card raise, part of the
"Bergen Raise" structure. West, with bare opening values, jumped
to four spades, a wafer-thin game that needed good breaks even
without West having any wasted strength in clubs and that the
field could not be expected to reach.

{
West's very weak preemptive jump raise over the intervening takeout
double had the effect such preempts often have, goading the opponents
to overbid. North strained to bid four hearts, prompting South
to drive to slam via "1430" Roman Key-Card Blackwood and the
