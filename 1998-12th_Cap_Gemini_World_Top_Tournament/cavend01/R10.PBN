{
We begin the Friday evening session following a red-hot pair
from middle America. Howard Weinstein and Steve Garner won bronze
medals at the World Teams Olympiad last year, finished second
at the Cap Gemini, and won the Cavendish Teams a day ago. Their
opponents for the first round are scions of the French national
team: multiple world champions - Paul Chemla and Alain Levy.
Weinstein's 2S advance denoted a limit raise or better in diamonds,
which probably had Chemla checking the backs of his cards. Did
everyone have a good hand? Well, yes.

{
There are some players who would open the East hand with 3C -
Levy isn't one of them. Some strong club pairs though, may start
with a natural 2C opening. When East passed, South opened a two-bid
of his own - a weak 2D. Chemla had an easy non-vulnerable entry
with 2H, and Weinstein nudged the bidding higher. Levy, not wishing
to be left out of the action, countered with a Responsive Double.
He unobtrusively shifted his C2 over to the spade suit to make
the bid more palatable. Fortunately, Chemla held three spades
only, and settled for 3H.

{
Garner's 2NT advance showed at least four trump, and an opening
bid. Weinstein's 3C rebid showed a minimum hand-type that may
or may not contain shortness. The 3D bid asked about any possible
singleton, and 4H said - "leave me alone, I have a balanced minimum".
That was enough for Garner to stay out of any trouble searching
for slam. Though, as we can see, if the DA and CQ were both onside
- twelve tricks. And, if for some reason, Chemla were to lead
a diamond from Q106 - twelve tricks.
