{
The opponents for this round are teammates from the winning Cavendish
Teams - Roy Welland and Bjorn Fallenius (Fred Gitelman-Brad Moss
were the third pair). Welland was given the typical bidding panel
problem as East. All rebids were flawed: 2NT shows the appropriate
point-count, but what of the anemic spade holding? 3H shows the
approximate point-count, but what of the lack of a fourth heart?

{
N/S would make 3D from the South seat certainly, so Fallenius
chose an excellent time to open a slightly shaded strong-notrump.
Though, N/S held 22 HCP, they simply had no convenient entry
into the auction. The simple transfer auction landed E/W in a
very comfortable contract. But with Garner and Weinstein on defense,
nothing is comfortable. A deadly H5 lead from Garner was taken
by Weinstein's ace. The C5 return went to Garner's queen, and
the CA, and a club ruff followed. The D3 went to Weinstein's
king, and the contract was booked.

{
A well-judged auction by both pairs and par was reached. If E/W
carry on with 4S, they would be doubled for minus 200. If N/S
judge to bid to the five-level in diamonds, they would find themselves
the H9 short of their goal. Weinstein showed incredible restraint,
even though the partnership open light, and downgraded his SQ
on the ensuing auction. As the auction wore on, Weinstein envisioned
two spade losers, and "one in the wash". Very well done.
