{
Two new pairs enter the stage. Marty Fleisher/Eric Rodwell as
E/W, and Mike Passell/Malcolm Brachman as N/S. All are world
champions except Fleisher but he is the defending champion here
(with Rodwell). The first hand offered a natural and uncontested
auction where Passell indicated that he might be interested in
slam but Brachman denied any such interest. The D10 lead was
won with dummy´s queen, and on a small heart from dummy East
hopped up with the ace and played back a small diamond, which
West ruffed to return a club.

{
N/S did well to stop in 4D after East preempted with 3H. Or did
they - 3NT, anyone? West led the HK and continued with a small
spade. Afraid of enemy ruffs it would seem that declarer may
not have realized that he needed some himself. He drew two rounds
of trumps, then, instead of going for spades he played a club
to king and ace. When West returned his last trump it was too
late to establish spades, so declarer went one down. N/S minus
50, and a heavy 77 IMPs for Fleisher and Rodwell.

{
Fleisher decided to rebid the hearts, rather than showing his
pretty good diamonds. After a club lead to South´s ace a trump
lead looked natural with the spade holding that South had. This
made it easy for declarer to make two overtricks, ruffing a club
and establishing a spade trick. N/S minus 480. Five pairs were
more ambitious, bidding slam, all in hearts. Two made it, three
didn´t. Fleisher/Rodwell gained another 30 IMPs.
