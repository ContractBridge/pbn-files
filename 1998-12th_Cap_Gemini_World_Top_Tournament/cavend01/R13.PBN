{
And, just as we leave the other four members of the winning Cavendish
Teams, we come across the third pair, Fred Gitelman and Brad
Moss. This pair have a number of outstanding results lately,
including silver in the 2000 Transnational Teams in Bermuda,
and second in the Anaheim Spingold. The opponents are household
names to the game of bridge. Billy Eisenberg has won five world
championships with several different partners, and Zia Mahmood
has won everything but a world championship.

{
Gitelman-Moss exchanged quite a bit of information on this deal.
They made a valiant attempt to get to a close slam on perfect-fitting
cards. On this particular layout 3NT would prove to be no problem.
However, on a bad day even that contract could fail (imagine
the CQ offside as well). So, this was a well-conducted auction.
After Gitelman's fourth-suit forcing 2C, Moss made a waiting
bid, more or less, with 2D. It's possible in their partnership
that 3C would denote a different hand-type. Gitelman showed what
his fourth-suit-hand was about with 3D.

{
Just because one suit is unguarded never stopped Zia from opening
notrump, and didn't stop him here. And, why not? The hand falls
in the partnership 2NT range (20-21), and a source of tricks
in spades make the bid almost mandatory. Who wants the rebid
problems after starting with 1S? Eisenberg surprised Zia by transferring
to his five-card suit. He solved this pleasant dilemma with a
super-accept leap to 4S. Moss led the CQ to declarer's ace, and
the trumps were drawn.
