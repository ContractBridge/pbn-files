{
West had a square hand with most of his strength in the form
of kings in the opponents' suits. His four-club advance of East's
distributional takeout double put his side in 800-number jeopardy,
but North couldn't muster up a double, and South, with an offensively-oriented
hand, preferred to bid game.

{
Many would open the South hand one spade, but one notrump with
all those picture-cards is also reasonable. A routine Stayman
auction led to the cold four-spade game. There was little to
the play, as the defenders took their three obvious tricks. Making
four spades, minus 420, for a small 10-IMP loss.

{
East's 4-card overcall on a weakish square hand combined with
West's preemptive jump raise on a very weak square hand robbed
South of the bidding space he might otherwise have used to probe
for the right game. Four spades was makable, but that was hard
for South to know, so he doubled three hearts.
