{
A Two-Over-One Game Force auction led, after some probing for
the right strain, to a small slam in the best fit.  There was
little to the play. Declarer took the opening lead with dummy's
DA and led the S10, no doubt intending to play SA and SK regardless.
When West covered, no doubt hoping that East had some spade strength,
declarer claimed an overtrick. Plus 1010, for a modest gain of
36 IMPs.

{
East's very-light one-diamond opening and one notrump rebid did
not tempt West to move beyond game, and West settled for a raise
to three notrump. South made the obvious CJ lead from his "God-given
sequence" (the late great analyst Edgar Kaplan's phrase). East
called for dummy's CQ and surrendered two club tricks and one
diamond trick early to retain control.
