{
 The new arrivals are Geoff Hampson/Eric Greco, winners of the
2000 Cavendish Teams. They open most 11-counts so Hampson's 1C
is in keeping with partnership style. After Nickell's light overcall,
Greco's negative double shows exactly four spades. He makes an
effort to reach 3NT but settles for 4S when he learns Hampson
has a minimum with no special features.

{
Greco's 2C is forcing to game, so he can safely rebid 3C over
Hampson's minimum 2NT to suggest slam. With just a bit in reserve,
Hampson tries 3S to show "where he lives" and that is enough
to convince Greco to take a shot at 6C. And with the slam played
from West, there are always twelve tricks coming in.

{
Both Eat and West would have opened the South hand, but that
is not Nickell's style. When Greco's 1C opening is greeted by
a natural and invitational 2NT response, his 13-count is in the
middle of the partnership range for a balanced minimum opening,
and it would seem that his mildly conservative decision to pass
is influenced by the vulnerability. With 4432 or a fifth club,
he would probably carry on to game, regardless.
