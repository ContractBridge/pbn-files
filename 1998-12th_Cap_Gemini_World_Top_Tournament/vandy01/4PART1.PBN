{
Our featured pair for the final session of the Open Pairs I are
the leaders, Henry Bethe and Varis Carey. When Bethe opened the
East hand with 1D, he was probably working out how to continue
the auction with a jump shift rebid. He needn't have worried
about that as N/S were in 4S before you could blink, and Bethe
was pressured into a decision at the five-level. Oddly, the defense
can garner six defensive tricks against 4S. E/W can cash two
diamonds and two clubs before playing a third round of diamonds
to score the singleton S10. A little cruel perhaps.

{
In this position and vulnerability, Bethe-Carey play a 14-17
HCP notrump, and this was Carey's choice. Opening 1NT with a
five-card major is a matter of style, but if the balanced hand
falls within one's notrump range, and the major isn't extremely
strong (eg. AKQ10x or the like), it is sound policy. Bethe had
no reason to remove 1NT opposite the announced point-count, and
the auction was over almost before it had begun. Spangler led
her only four-card suit, and this ran to declarer's jack. Declarer
returned the D3.

{
Carey was charmed to leave in partner's takeout double of 2D.
There was no inclination to bid those four little hearts at the
two-level. Just as well, as 2H would fail with the E/W cards
due to the foul trump break. "Why should we go down when they
can go down?" This deal was all about plus scores. The matchpoints
would flow to the pairs who could avoid going minus. Carey chose
the S9 for his opening lead, and declarer won the ace in dummy.
He played a club to the king, and began to take heart ruffs in
dummy.

{
The West hand has a difficult rebid after 1H-1S-?. Carey went
for the least of evils 2NT rebid. If the H2 were the D2 it would
be considered a perfect rebid. In essence, that is what good
bidding is all about. If you can't find a bid that suits a particular
hand - simply move a small card from your longest suit, and place
it elsewhere mentally. If this makes your bid more palatable
- choose it. Once Carey went this route, it was very easy for
Bethe to conclude the auction with a 4S bid. No muss, no fuss.

{
The auction produced by Bethe-Carey was likely duplicated at
a majority of tables in the event. If anyone arrived in 4H and
made it, they didn't deserve the huge score. This is a VERY poor
game to be in. Having said that, note how friendly the layout
in the majors were for declarer. Hayden found the best lead for
the defense when he selected the D3. Declarer knocked out the
SA, and Whitman returned the C8, rather than pressing the diamond
attack.

{
The North hand was just beyond the partnership's overcall range,
and Hayden chose to double at his first opportunity. Now the
focus shifted to the South hand. What should Whitman respond
after the takeout double? The choices were 1S and 1H. He just
doesn't hold the high-card strength for 1NT. Since he was, more
or less, endplayed into bidding a three-card major, he might
as well bid the stronger of the two. All of a sudden, North's
hand looked very good, and Hayden advanced with a 2D cue-bid.
Bethe expressed lead aspirations with a double.

{
Everyone's 3NT. North's 3NT announced 13-15 HCP, and tended to
deny a four-card major. Unfortunately, N/S's combined spade holding
accounted for nine HCP, but only two tricks. When Bethe led a
spade, the contract was in serious jeopardy. Declarer needed
the club hook to work, or he was going down (unless the spades
were seven-two and there was no entry to the long spades). Declarer
tried the effect of the CJ, and when Bethe played low, relied
on Zia's Bols Tip ("If they don't cover, they don't have it."),
and went up with the CA.

{
A terrific matchpoint board. E/W have a four-four heart fit that
should be avoided on this particular day. Note that the E/W hands
are perfectly mirrored, and notrump is far preferable to a suit
contract. Now, even if E/W can avoid the heart trap, there is
a small matter of every suit requiring a bit of work. The defense
will help on opening lead as they have to broach one suit or
another. Those alighting in 4H will definitely have their work
cut out. Declarer actually must play the HA or low to the ace
on the first round of hearts to avoid a heart loser.

{
Greenspan's 2H opening was of the weak variety, but could be
on a five-card suit. The heart spots might have been a little
better, but N/S obviously prefer the rough and tumble approach.
The 2H bid attracted a takeout double from Bethe. Normally one
stretches to act when short in the preemptor's suit, and here
he was. Perry, South, did her best with an obstructive 4H effort.
Carey could have extracted an 800 penalty from this, but quite
naturally went for the vulnerable game bonus. Doubling might
have required a perfect layout for success.

{
Another interesting matchpoint deal. E/W can make 2H or 1NT,
and N/S can make 2C (unless the defense arranges to score the
C10). The tempo of the auction would set the stage. The auction
started naturally enough, and West ventured 1H in the sandwich
position. This was a good effort, and got his side involved.
N/S exchanged some more natural and limited information before
coming to a stop in 2C. Now it was up to East to defend 2C, or
find a call with his scattered eleven-count. One can make a case
either way. A 2H bid would have been a success on this occasion.

{
The West hand really doesn't fall into the Michaels genre. It
is neither a poor hand nor a very good hand, so it feels more
like a spade overcall, with a hopeful diamond bid later, if possible.
Letizia, North, was rather surprised that partner opened her
six-card suit, and chose the obvious course of action. As happens
on these types of auctions, the 4H bid proved to be a transfer
to 4S for the opponents. Glubok's hand didn't look very defensive,
so bid 5H. Carey, with a similar trump holding as Glubok, ventured
5S.

{
The E/W hands have the supposed high-card strength to attempt
3NT - 26 HCP. Both were balanced, and no eight-card major-suit
fit existed. There was the small matter of a spade stopper missing,
but that was partially negated by the fact that E/W had a three-three
fit in the suit (and that N/S didn't bid the suit). So, one would
expect the majority of the field to arrive in 3NT. They found
themselves a trick short when the clubs failed to break, and
the HQ didn't drop singleton or doubleton. Our E/W pair avoided
that pitfall.

Three passes to Carey had him using the "Rule of Fifteen" (add
HCP to number of spades - if fifteen or more = opener) to barely
scrape up an opening bid. Sontag got his lead-directional bid
into the mix, and Bethe's 2D bid closed proceedings. Collier's
hand wasn't quite right for any move with only a doubleton spade,
so she sensibly passed. A wise move as any N/S contract was destined
to fail miserably. The cards behaved remarkably well for E/W.
The DK was onside, and the trumps were three-three. The HK and
the CA also were onside for declarer.

North-South reached three notrump on a Stayman auction that I'd

mediocre 10 HCP, especially if South can have one of the junky
15-HCP notrumps that have become commonplace nowadays. No matter,
South had a prime 15 HCP with two (huge!) tens.

Carey did well to jump to five clubs with his distributional
hand: let the opponents guess at the five-level. South, however,
did not do well to double; if her partner couldn't double their
vulnerable opponents, how could she with her singleton trump?
Much better to sacrifice in five hearts.

When North bid one heart (forcing, in the modern style) over
West's hair-raising takeout double, East did not have quite enough
to double (it's good to expect to beat what you double). South's
three notrump at her third turn was an overbid when North might
have little for his preference, but North had enough to bid game
over a two-notrump invitation anyway.

Balancing jumps never being weak, Carey could have simplified
the auction by bidding two spades when North's minimum one-diamond
opening came round to him. Carey's actual sequence didn't show
his strength clearly, but having two high spade honors, Bethe
wasn't about to pass three spades - nor bid the double-dummy
three notrump with clubs wide open.

North's two notrump (distributional takeout for the blacks) forced
South to bid three spades with only three. (Actually, South had
very useful bits and pieces.) Under pressure of preemption, West
bid at the four-level with only three-level values. Weak trumps
and an auction that heralded bad splits didn't deter East from
bidding game. North's double added insult to injury.

South opened a weakish notrump. I'm strongly opposed to a double
of one notrump that shows a one-suiter, as West's did here, but
this time it offered a big benefit: East could bid two diamonds
to override his partner at the two-level. Alas, West foolishly
insisted on his own suit and East, with more justification, overrode
him again.

 Many weak-notrump devotees think transfers foolish when opener
has at most 14 or 15 HCP. I disagree; most contracts still play
better from the notrumper's side. Here North's weakish notrump
and South's Jacoby Transfer right-sided two hearts, though a
balancing two spades by West would have negated any benefit.
Come to think of it, why didn't West bid two spades?

Once in a while, a perfect situation for Roman Key-Card Blackwood
arises, and this was it. West's five-spade reply to four notrump
showed two keys plus extra trump length equivalent to the queen,
and East bid the laydown slam. Oops, did I say "perfect"? The
use of four notrump to ask precluded reaching the double-dummy
matchpoint contract of six notrump from West's side.

{
West's standard one-notrump overcall may seem routine, but no
notrump overcall with a stack in opener's suit looks routine
to me, especially with both sides vulnerable. Often, whichever
side buys the contract is destined for defeat, and plus 200 is
a mighty fine matchpoint score. A pass by West here would give
"forcing notrumpers" a chance to reach a failing two hearts.
