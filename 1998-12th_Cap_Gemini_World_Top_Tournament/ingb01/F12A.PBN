In spite of the trump lead declarer is still in the position
to ruff a spade in dummy for his eighth trick. By the way, Jean-Paul
Vis does a good job by bidding 2C instead of 1NT. The latter
contract is down after a diamond lead.

{
It looks peculiar, to go up with the DA at first opportunity.
A closer look however learns that - after the club lead -  it
is the only way to defeat 3NT. If declarer is allowed to win
the first diamond, he then gets the opportunity to develop the
spades for two tricks. So a brilliant defensive stroke by Jean-Paul
Vis who naturally switched to a heart.

[Contract "3NT"]
[Declarer "S"]
{
Against the thin game Jean-Paul Vis correctly avoids the spade
lead, which would have presented declarer with his ninth trick
immediately. Vis has no clue who holds the SJ, so he elects to
pitch the S10 on first opportunity: suit preference for hearts.
Ricco van Prooijen could have ducked the first round of hearts
to keep it as an entry for his to-be-developed club. Vis could
have done better as well. After winning the SA, cash the HK and
exit with a club.
