{
OR - When North passed her borderline hand, West was afforded
the opportunity to open 1S. When N/S competed efficiently to
4D Jason bid what he thought (hoped) he could make. A scientific
approach didn't seem appropriate on this jammed auction. West
would have been more than pleased if East held the three queens
for his suits. Two out of three queens, and the H10 gave him
a good play. The DA lead provided a useless pitch, and declarer
took two heart finesses to go down one: plus 50 for N/S.

CR - Here, North opened 1D, and South, expecting West to hold
a strong hand, psyched 1S. West doubled for takeout, and when
East bid a free 2H, West apparently made a "serious slam-try"
of 3NT. East showed remarkable confidence in her partner's evaluation
because she jumped all the way to 6H. North was virtually certain
the HA was on his right and doubled the final contract. He scored
his two trump tricks in due course: minus 100; 2 IMPs to Mavromichalis.

OR - North bypassed the diamond suit, and responded 1S with the
potential one-bid hand. East showed his red suits with 2NT, and
South announced four-card spade support and a long strong club
suit 4C. West bid 4H with the expectations of a make, and bid
on to 5H over 4S. His red cards were the determining factor here.
North doubled, and led the CQ. South overtook and shifted to
the D3. The defense took their diamond ruff for down one: minus
200.

CR - The auction began the same way, but here East decided to
emphasize her heart suit, rather than announce a two-suiter.
South splintered with 4H, and West began to show her hand. She
doubled 4H to imply heart values, and then doubled 4S to express
doubt about the 4S contract. Declarer played well to negate West's
six and three of spades, but couldn't avoid the loss of the HA,
a club ruff for East, and West's AJ of spades. Down one: minus
100, and 7 IMPs to China Women. They led at this point: 51 to
20.

OR - Once Jason passed the West hand in second seat and refrained
from doubling for takeout at his next turn, N/S splintered their
way to the good 4S. Had Justin been willing (or able, conventionally)
to double 4C E/W might have backed into their laydown 5C. West
led the DK and shifted to the H9. Declarer was about to claim,
when the four-zero trump break halted her lean-forward. She tried
the HK, and West ruffed, cashed the DA, and led a club to partner's
ace for one down: minus 100.

CR - Here, West opened a Precision 1D, and North doubled, where
many of his peers would settle for a simple overcall. That worked
well for Lair when East passed and the spade fit came to light
immediately. Here too, East did not double the 4C splinter bid,
and her side also lost any chance of scoring up the vulnerable
5C. West badly misjudged the defense when she cashed both high
diamonds before shifting to the H9. [DC] Declarer now had the
time to score the DQ, a diamond ruff, 3H and 5S to make his game.
Plus 620, and 12 IMPs to Mavromichalis.

to bid her three-card club suit. The potential of the diamond
suit never materialized. A 2S cue-bid from South received a leap
to 3NT, and the neither red suit was given the respect it merited.

free 2D bid. He admitted to his club control over the 3S splinter,
and South took control with RKCB. 5C showed three keycards, and
5H requested the DQ. North's 6D showed it (without no side king),
and South, expecting a sixth diamond, bid the grand slam. A cool
plus 1440, and 14 IMPs to Mavromichalis (6D would have won 10
IMPs - so 7D risked a lot).

{
OR - South's slightly off-center 1NT was overcalled with a natural
2S, and North began a Lebensohl sequence with 2NT. Her intention
was to cue-bid 3S over the puppet 3C as Stayman with a spade
stopper. East foiled this plan with a 3S call of his own. Perhaps
North should double on the way out, rather than bid 3NT. Her
3NT bid announced a spade stopper, but the four-card heart suit
didn't get a full hearing. 3NT suffered from the obvious failing,
and when the defense got in, cashed their five spades and two
aces for down three: minus 300.

{
CR - In this room, N/S brushed aside the 2D overcall (sound major-suit
overcall) with a negative double. The heart fit was uncovered,
and game bid. The SK lead got the defense off on the right track,
and the four-one heart break was going to cause some discomfort.
When East was in with the DA, she failed to deliver the diamond
ruff to defeat 4H. Instead, she returned the CJ which ran to
the queen (CA, low spade also defeats the contract), and declarer
rapidly claimed ten tricks: plus 620, and 14 IMPs to Mavromichalis,
pulling away now: 90 to 60.
