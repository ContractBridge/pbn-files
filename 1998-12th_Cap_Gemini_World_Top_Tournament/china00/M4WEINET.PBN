{
OR - Over Mark Molson's strong club, Jack Zhao started with a
gentle 2C, expecting further opportunities to show his tremendous
playing strength. Juanita Chambers was able to describe her hand
fairly well with a direct 3D (0-7 HCP, and at least six diamonds.
West bid only clubs and with East, Berry Westra, uninvolved,
it ended at 5D. Chambers, made six with the SK onside: plus 620.

{
CR - In contrast to Zhao, Tobi Sokolow, overcalled 1H, and then
bid her clubs twice in a contested auction. Louk Verhees, South,
bid in a similar manner to Molson in the Open Room, and bought
the hand in 4NT. Once Janice Molson volunteered 4H it is surprising
that Sokolow did not bid over 4NT. Declarer needed the spade
finesse to make 4NT: plus 690, and 2 IMPs to Holland.

{
OR - Zhao would not have enjoyed the play in 1NT doubled, but
his partnership scrambled into 2C (East's pass may have forced
a redouble), which would have been a fairly safe haven (2H fares
a trick worse). Chambers bid only 2D now (3D would be forcing),
and played there. With the aid of a club lead, declarer disposed
of her heart loser on the CJ, and came to eleven tricks: plus
150.

{
CR - Here too E/W wriggled into 2C, but from the West side. Van
Cleeff passed (forcing) to obtain a further opinion from his
partner. When he continued with 2NT over 2S South was not inclined
to cut it too fine and raised to 3NT. Janice Molson's excellent
lead of the H3 produced an easy set. A club lead works too but
only if West shifts to the HK. Minus 50: 5 IMPs to the Wei team,
ahead 10-3 in the early going.

OR - North made the normal lead of the H2, ducked to the king.
Declarer won the HA and played towards the AK3 of diamonds twice,
in an effort to keep South off play. If South had played the
D4 to the first diamond, declarer would have ducked. With the
actual layout, declarer had no chance after the opening lead.
Twist and turn as he might, eight tricks were the limit. Down
one: minus 100.

{
CR - The play started the same way as in the Open Room but here,
when declarer played the D2 from dummy, Louk Verhees, South,
made the expert play (or was it?) of the DQ, catering to declarer's
AJ8 holding with a subsequent misguess. As he had no other entry,
this was an error [DC]. Sokolow ran four clubs, and when North
released the SJ, declarer built a second spade winner for her
ninth trick. Plus 600: 12 IMPs to Wei, 23-9.

OR - West's double of the strong club apparently did not show
to a two-suiter because East would surely have competed to the
four-level in a hurry. With plenty of room to explore, N/S uncovered
their diamond fit, and cue-bid to the excellent diamond slam.
A 6H sacrifice would cost 800 or 1100, depending on the defense.
Declarer crossruffed his way to twelve tricks. N/S plus 1370.

CR - North had an interesting decision to make over 1S and chose
a leap to 5D, which was met by an aggressive responsive double
from East, but West passed, perhaps misinterpreting the double
[DC]. The "stripe-tailed-ape-double" had made a cameeo appearance.
The SA lead allowed declarer the time for all thirteen tricks.

CR - Here Sokolow treated 3S as forcing, but 4D was clearly passable,
so she gave up. The excellent D2 lead went to the ten and queen
and a club was ducked to South's nine. After CA and a spade switch,
declarer couldn't shut out the DJ late in the day: minus 100.
Curiously the play in diamonds was leff comfortable than in spades.
6 IMPs to the Netherlands, who were within 9 IMPs with one board
left. It ended 35-21 for Wei.
