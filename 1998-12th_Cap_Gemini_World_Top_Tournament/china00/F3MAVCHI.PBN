{
OR - Standard practice light opening bid in the South seat from
Justin. Yu Zhang's free 2H bid excited Wenfei Wang, who splintered
with 4C. East's 4D further improved West's hand and RKCB revealed
one keycard. 5D asked for the HQ, but when East denied that card,
West changed her mind, and bid slam anyway, counting on East
to read the hand well on the auction. Her faith in East's declarer
play was rewarded when both major-suits were accurately negotiated:
plus 1430.

CR - E/W were given a free run in this room, and of course, that
gave them no clues about the N/S holding. East (advance) cue-bid
his DK over West's 3H, but even that didn't excite West with
his sub-minimum jump shift. Declarer guessed hearts but not spades,
and arrived at eleven tricks: plus 650 for E/W, and 13 IMPs to
China Women. It was a good thing that Lair-Helgemo had stopped
in game, or the cost would have been 17 IMPs. Early in the second
half, the score was: Mavromichalis 99 - China Women 73.

OR - Justin, South, made the good decision to raise partner's
hearts rather than rebid his strong six-card club suit at his
second turn. East got the defense off to a great start with her
imaginative S6 lead. West's jack won, and a low heart return
at this point would have made declarer's task extremely difficult.
She switched t the D3. however, and declarer won, ruffed a diamond
and played three high clubs. West ruffed with the H6, declarer
went about his business, and secured eight tricks: plus 110.

CR - The Precision 2C opening buried the modest heart fit. No
one had any cause to disturb this contract, and the D3 lead was
taken by dummy's ace. When the CJ lost to the queen, declarer
knew she wasn't going to enjoy the rest of the play. Declarer
eventually managed four clubs, one diamond, and one spade for
two down: minus 200, and 7 IMPs to Mavromichalis, who now led
in the Final of the China Cup by, 123-79.

OR - Jason's 3D was natural and invitational. Justin probed with
3S, but gave up over 3NT, not without concern. In reality, N/S
were the D10 away from a good 6D. The 3NT contract presented
little problem on a club lead, and declarer soon had twelve tricks
with the aid of the club finesse (once diamonds failed to break
three-three): plus 490 for N/S. A spade lead would have ruined

{
CR - The Chinese Precision auction did arrive in 6D when South
chose to carry on over partner's 3NT bid with a quantitative
4NT. The auction seemed to indicate to North that South held
a doubleton diamond at least, and indeed if it was Qx, the slam
would be a very good one. Now, the slam depended on a three-three
diamond break for success. Oddly, 6NT (with no spade lead) gives
declarer the extra chance of the club finesse (if East can't
play clubs twice through dummy before diamonds are fully tested).
Down one: minus 50, and 11 IMPs to Mavromichalis.

{
OR - E/W brushed aside South's 1S bid (natural though it was),
and arrived in a 2S contract that was due to score plus 110.
North bid his hand once too often, and found himself playing
in 3H doubled. 2H said it all, and 3H was gilding the lily, at
best. [DC] However, today was his lucky day when absolutely everything
(barring the AQ doubleton of diamonds onside) behaved. He lost
one spade, two diamonds, and two clubs for down one only: minus
100.

{
CR - Although Yalan Zhang thought she could afford to jump to
3H as she had not opened a strong 1C, Ling Gu was apparently
expecting both a seventh heart and a fast trick when she shot
out 3NT. Lair's double increased the stakes and  Helgemo did
well to switch to a low diamond, ducked to West's queen. Two
down: minus 300. That was another 5 IMPs to Mavromichalis to
end the third quarter. Mavromichalis 140 - China Women 83. A
57-IMP lead with sixteen boards left would be an uphill battle
against a team playing in good form.
