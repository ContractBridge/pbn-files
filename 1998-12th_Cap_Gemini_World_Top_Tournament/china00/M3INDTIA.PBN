{
OR - After Kuang Yuegang's weak notrump, Zheng Yixin transferred
to hearts, then forced with a natural 3D. 3NT suggested a doubleton
heart and black-suit stoppers and over West's 4C probe, East
tried to slow down the auction with 4H. It appears that 4NT was
simple Blackwood rather than quantitative and West drove to 6NT.
Even if diamonds broke, this was a nearly impossible contract
on a spade lead, which kills declarer's communications. If East
held the HQ instead of the HJ, slam would be more reasonable.
Declarer managed ten tricks for two down: minus 100.

{
CR - The Indonesian E/W pair might open 1C with only two cards
(4432), but Panelewen's 1S confirmed that he held at least three.
Apparently their "default" position over the fourth-suit-forcing
2D with no heart support and no diamond stopper is to bid 3C
but even so it is strange that West, after showing his red suits,
did not continue with 4C. Still, his quantitative 4NT worked
beautifully when Panelewen was able to pass it. Pus 460. An 11-IMP
swing to Indonesia, who opened up a 23-2 IMP lead early.

OR - Franky Karwur's 3C showed shortage (a treatment adopted
during Eric Kokish's training mission). Denny Sacul, who had
forced to game on the strength of his club suit, had reason to
backpedal now. Zheng led the D8 to dummy's singleton king, and
declarer ran the S8 successfully. Once the spades broke three-two
declarer was able to hold his losses to one spade and two hearts.
To defeat the contract Kuang had to split his spade honors and
eventually arrange a heart ruff with his small trump. Once he
failed to split, declarer was in control. Plus 620 for N/S.

a lead that spared his partner any problems - the S2. This forced
Panelewen to split his honors, and when he was in with the SK,
he had no problem playing a heart through declarer. He soon received

mildly eccentric weak notrump came around to him. Karwur took
him seriously and raised to 4S, but the sound of the auction
did not talk Zheng out of doubling for penalty. Kuang found the
best lead of the HQ and continued the suit. Sacul lost tricks
to the SQ and S8 (on a third-round diamond ruff) and although
the latter endplayed East to concede the CK, Sacul couldn't avoid
the loss of a third trump trick, one heart and one club. Two

{
OR - Kuang began with a negative double on the East cards, and
then bid game in hearts at his second turn. This was dictated
by Zheng's "free" 3H bid over Karwar's 2S. The SJ lead went to
South's ace, and the D9 was returned. Declarer judged well to
allow the DQ to hold the trick, and when Sacul cashed the CK
(an error) [DC], Zheng was in firm control. He could take the
spade ruff in dummy, and get back to hand with a club ruff to
draw the outstanding trumps. A second diamond (the king!) by
Sacul would have defeated the game. Plus 420 for E/W.

{
CR - Ling preferred a takeout double with the North cards. The
popular modern style is to overcall instead, catering best to
a possible five-three spade fit. Panelewen's 1NT bid was a transfer
to clubs, but when he converted to hearts he showed a doubleton
heart and about 8-10 points with no reference to clubs. When
Ling protected with 2S, Panelewen competed with an action double.
West, with limited defense, retreated to 3H. The defense managed
their diamond ruff at this table to hold declarer to nine tricks.
Plus 140 for E/W, but 7 IMPs to Tianjin.

{
OR - The Indonesian N/S conducted a quiet natural auction to
a perfectly normal 2C contract. The H7 went to East's ace, and
the D2 was returned. Declarer went up ace, and oddly cashed the
SA, before playing the C10! It would seem that a better line
might be: DA, heart to the queen, spade to the ace, HK - pitching
the DQ, and attempt a crossruff. [DC] In any case, declarer found
his way to nine tricks, losing one heart, one diamond and two
clubs. Plus 110 for N/S.

{
CR - The auction was identical at this table until Panelewen
decided to balance with 2H. With everyone vulnerable and no indication
that a true fit had been found, this bid was somewhat ill-judged
[DC] and in practice got exactly what it deserved. It was doubled
and went down two: minus 500.  9 IMPs to Tianjin, bringing them
back into the match. The running score was now: Indonesia 41
- Tianjin 30.

himself an inward smile when West responded 1S. The natural auction
came to rest in 2H, and Gao led the D7. Ling allowed the DQ to
hold the first trick, and declarer led the H5 to his king. This
allowed North two trump tricks, and the defense now came to six
