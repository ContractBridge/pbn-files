{
OR - Jan van Cleeff opened 2H (Muiderberg), showing hearts and
a minor, about 5-11. Wenfei Wang resisted the temptation to compete
with a fair playing hand, and it was left to Yu Zhang in the
reopening position, with the best hand at the table. Fearing
a response in diamonds if she doubled, she passed and so missed
an excellent vulnerable 4S. The S3 lead allowed club pitches,
and declarer managed eight tricks: plus 110, a nice result for
N/S.

CR - Ling Gu, lacking a two-suited weapon, didn't care for any
single-suited options and passed. Jack Zhao considered his peculiar
collection suitable for aweak two-bid (via a Multi 2D) Berry
Westra's 4C asked his partner to bid one step under his major.
South came alive now with a "two places to play" 4NT bid. Over
Yalan Zhang's 5D East, believing West had a vulnerable weak-two,
bid 5H, pass-or-correct. West's 5S received the red card. Down
two on a club misguess: minus 500. 9 IMPs to China (Women).

OR - N/S conducted a natural auction up to the 3H bid. This was,
more or less, a fourth-suit probe, looking for 3NT. When South
didn't produce the requested heart stopper with a 4C response,
North went for what he thought was a sound eight-plus-card fit
5D. West proved this to be untrue by laying down her top three
hearts, forcing dummy to ruff. This promoted East's K93 of diamonds
into the setting trick. Declarer needed specifically king doubleton
of diamonds on his right to make the game. Down one, and plus
100 for E/W.

CR - The Chinese women bid identically to their Open Room counterparts...to
a point. North expected Qx or xxx of clubs in partner's hand
for the 4C bid, and bid 5C, catering to the possibility of three
small hearts in partner's hand (in which case three rounds of
hearts might damage the diamond suit, but not the club suit).
After three rounds of hearts, declarer was home when the clubs
weren't five-one, and the diamond finesse worked. Plus 600 for
N/S, and 12 IMPs to China Women, taking the lead 28-24.

OR - Note: Handle with care! This hand is here to show you the
dangers of psyching. Everything began quietly until North's second
opportunity to speak. The negative double on his right convinced
him that the opponents had at least a spade game, and his answer
to that was a monkey-wrench 1S bid. South, taking him seriously,
jumped to 4S. "I'll run to 5H when they double us", thought North.
The D5 was led. North was allowed to ruff two diamonds in hand,
and escaped for down three: minus 300.

CR - Despite the obvious flaws with East's 1NT opening bid, it
has merits. The 16 HCP fall within the notrump range of 15-17
nicely, and there is no four-card major to worry about, and there
is a source of tricks in clubs. West doubled South's major-suit
2D to show some cards, but when 3H was bid on his right, he reluctantly
subsided. A cross-ruff netted declarer ten tricks: plus 170 for
N/S. 10 IMPs to China (Women), who had the lead, 38-25.

OR - East upgraded her hand to strong club status, and South
intervened with 2D. After West's forcing 2H, North bid a lead-directing
2S. This was met with a double, but West knew where this was
leading, and concluded the auction with a 4H bid. The DK held
the first trick, and declarer won the continuation with the ace.
The DJ was ruffed with the H10, and the HK played to South's
ace. The D8 went to the H8, over-ruffed with the H9. Declarer
took the spade finesse for her tenth trick: plus 420.

CR - In this room, E/W had a free run to the 4H game. The Open
Room pointed suits were road-mapped for declarer, but here West
was on his own. The DK was led, and when declarer allowed it
to hold, the D2 came back. When West inserted the DJ, he was
done. South won, and returned a diamond. The trump ptromotion
could not be avoided, and the H9 became the setting trick. An
unfortunate down one: minus 50. 10 more IMPs to China Women,
who were beginning to pull away. The score was now: China Women
62 - Netherlands 25.

{
OR - North's 3C opening won't be found in anyone's textbook,
but he was, after all,  white vs red in third seat. This gave
East little choice other than to bid 3NT with her minor-suit
stoppers. As is often the case, a preempt goads the opponents
into a game they never would have reached on their own steam.
South led a heart (a bizarre choice - DC), and when the SQ proved
friendly, declarer took ten tricks. Plus 630.

{
CR - Here, E/W were allowed a free run, and had a completely
normal natural auction to 2NT. Two balanced hands bidding to
a 24-point 2NT seems a perfectly acceptable evaluation. The defense
found the diamond lead to hold declarer to nine tricks. Plus
150, but another 10 IMPs for China Women, who had pitched a shutout
since Board # 11. This was the final nail in the Netherlands'
coffin, and they succumbed by a final total of 84 to 25. The
Chinese Women's team was in fine form, and would play Mavromichalis
in the Final.
