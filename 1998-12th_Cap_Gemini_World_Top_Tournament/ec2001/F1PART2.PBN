{
Despite holding good diamond stoppers, East might have chosen
to slow down the auction somewhat, rather than risk having his
passed partner put him in too high a 3NT contract. If West's
2D bid did imply heart support, East could have tried 2H, despite
the general nature of his hand.

{
Simple bidding got E/W to a good 3NT contract that could only
go down on a poor spade division and a spade lead, unlikely due
to West's spade response. Any North leading spades to hold declarer
to his contract should receive an excellent score. North could
of course not be faulted for leading his partner's suit, whereafter
declarer simply took his ten tricks. 3NT made four, minus 430
for N/S.

{
South at most tables will not open the bidding, and then those
E/W pairs playing weak notrumps have the best chance of finding
their spade fit for a fine score if they can manage to stay out
of game, as they will take nine tricks. Opposite a strong notrump,
however, most Easts are unlikely to disturb that contract in
an attempt to find a spade fit. The same applies to the auction
at this table.

[Contract "2S"]
[Declarer "S"]
{
Sensible bidding led to a sensible N/S contract. The play and
defense presented some interesting aspects. After winning the
HA at Trick Three, East returned a trump to try to prevent heart
ruffs. Once declarer chose to let this spade lead run to dummy,
successfully, he opted not to ruff any heart, but use dummy's
other spade for a 'proven' trump finesse to cater to four spades
in the East hand. When the spades split three-three, he turned
his attention to diamonds, finessing against the DJ in the West
hand, but also endplying East in the red suits.

{
A simple auction to a normal contract. Too bad declarer wasn't
clairvoyant enough to hop up with the HA (what could the H9 lead
be from?). After the clubs had produced two tricks and were good
for one more only, declarer tried the diamond finesse for two
extra tricks. The finesse lost and the defense eventually took
all the tricks it was entitled to. 1NT made one, minus 90 for
N/S.

[Contract "1D"]
[Declarer "N"]
{
North must have hoped for the auction to take a different course,
but was left to play 1D. If West balances with 1H (which would
probably go two down), N/S may end up in a spade or club partscore,
making at the two and three level, respectively. North managed
eight tricks in diamonds when the defense tried to cash the CA
and lead the HQ after having gained the lead with their spade
tricks. He took four tricks in diamonds, one in spades, one in
hearts, and two in clubs when the CQ came down after West had
erroneously discarded a club.| nt|Notice that declarer set up
a third heart winner by forcing out the HJ before cashing the
HK. A second heart trick (his seventh trick) vanished when the
trumps broke badly and East ruffed the HK. It came back when
East had to give the dummy the CK, and the CJ was trick Number
Eight when West's CQ fell. Declarer could, however, have cashed
his heart tops and thrown East in by playing the S7 and, if East
does not ruff, the D7. The CK will be his eighth trick. If the
CQ still drops, he will take nine tricks. 1D made two, plus 90
for N/S.

[Contract "2H"]
[Declarer "W"]
{
East's 1C was the weak notrump variety of the Polish club opening.
This, he confirmed when he rebid 1NT.  His 2H call in the next
round was not altogether prudent with so much in the opponents'
suits, a possible four-three fit and likely bad trump break.
Fortunately, West had something to spare, and the trump spots
made all the difference.

[Contract "3NT"]
[Declarer "W"]
{
East-West had a standard strong notrump auction to reach 3NT.
North led the HK and declarer won the ace to assure himself of
a second (fourth-round) heart stopper. He now took a winning
spade finesse for his ninth trick, and then started to develop
his hearts. North won and shifted to diamonds, South winning
his DJ when West ducked in dummy. After South had returned a
spade, it became too dangerous for declarer to try another diamond
finesse or establish another heart trick. He therefore cashed
out. 3NT made three, minus 600 for NS.

chose to compete further in notrump rather than double for penalties.
