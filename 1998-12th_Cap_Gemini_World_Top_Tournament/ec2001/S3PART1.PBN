{
Welcome to the third semi-final session of the European Open
Pairs Championship in Sorrento, Italy. We will be following Sascha
Wernle and Jovanka Smederevac from Austria. They play a strong
club system with step responses, and canapé style limited opening
bids. The session started out quietly when their Polish opponents
chose to play at the two-level in their 5-2 spade fit in preference
to the 4-4 diamond fit. West's 1NT response was forcing and his
false preference for spades was 'matchpoints'.

{
West's 2C was Stayman and East's response to his 3D enquiry indicated
three hearts and two spades. This systemic approach may have
backfired badly as at other tables, North may be on lead following
a Jacoby transfer sequence which would make West declarer in
a heart contract. Without a diamond lead twelve tricks will be
easy. Wernle, South, did very well by cashing his diamond tops,
holding declarer to his contract. 4H made four, minus 420 for
NS.

{
South's 1S opening bid had the advantage of uncovering the spade
fit right away. North bid 2NT, forcing, to show spade support
and South jumped to game to indicate his minimum hand. South
at most other tables will open with 1C and West will probably
overcall 1NT. NS are then in a position to double for at least
a 500 point penalty. Any runout will suffer a similar fate -
with 2D being the best of a bad lot.

The auction at this table will likely be duplicated at many other

a spade game. That contract will go down unless declarer guesses
to lead the SQ first, pinning Easts' S9, and finesse the S7 next
(this will require Dummy to be entered a second time, which doesn't
seem likely).

South's 1C opening bid showed 16+ HCP and East did well by jumping
to 3H over North's negative double. North's subsequent double
of 3H was a typical matchpoint decision in an effort to obtain
compensation for a likely NS partscore somewhere. It was just
as well that South held DKJ rather than the DA, for with a probable
eight fast tricks he might have bid 3NT after partner had doubled
3H, counting on a heart stopper/trick in the North hand - in
vain.

{
Although many players would prefer to jump to 4H on the South
hand at this vulnerability, this would most likely not have stopped
EW from reaching 6S. South's 2H overcall, however, allowed West
to splinter. No serious attempt was made to reach a grand slam.
East ran out of bids after West's 5D cuebid. Would 5H be anything
other than showing a heart control? With the proper Blackwood
machinery, the heart void, DA, CK, and DK might have come to
light and allow the grand to be bid with some confidence.

If playing 15-17 notrumps - these days pretty well the universal

on the heavy side. Fortunately, West was more than good enough
to respond, and the 3NT contract was reached as, no doubt, it
would be at every other table.

West started proceedings with a rather uncontrolled Multi 2D
opening (in love and matchpoints...). East's 2S indicated a good
hand for hearts but no desire to go beyond 2S if that, rather
than hearts, were his partner's major. North, in the balancing
seat, stuck her neck out but was rescued when partner retreated
to 3D after East had doubled 3C. That contract was doubled too,
but yielded more tricks than 3C would have.

{
An EW 2S contract is cold, but hard to reach unless East guesses
to bid it, though South would likely bid 3NT in that case. As
3NT is easy for NS, with the SA being onside, our featured pair
had to inflict a two-trick set. The CQ opening was not a good
start, however, as it allowed declarer to trade his diamond loser
for a natural trump trick. The reprieve was only temporary, for
declarer's trump position in the subsequent play became too weakened
to really take adavantage of the spade suit.

{
The NS 2S contract will likely be reached at the majority of
tables. Declarer can make eleven tricks if she goes all out and
guesses hearts. But the diamond opening lead and diamond return
after East won the CA had shortened her trumps to the extent
that she did not dare rely on a three-three trump break. Consequently,
she only made two overtricks. 2S made four, plus 170 for NS.

South opened 1S and West cuebided 2S, Michaels, to show hearts

West might have helped matters if he had not doubled 6S, for
this call suggested a singleton spade in his hand and gave East
no further options. Of course, had West passed, East would still
have faced a tough decision, but he might have guessed right.

{
This will probably be a flat board, at least in the bidding.
At most tables West will start with 1NT and East will raise to
3NT. The detour at this table changes very little. The only point
of interest is how declarer plays the heart suit after losing
a trick to the SK. By then he has ten tricks, and must take the
right view to make it eleven. Johansen guessed right after being
put to the test at Trick Two. 3NT made five, minus 460 for NS.

Despite her black monster, South left the final bidding decision
to her partner who understandably opted for a double rather than
carrying on in spades, although 5S can't be beaten. Would this
judgement call be borne out in the play? The first break for
NS occurred when the clubs divided 3-3. Declarer won the spade
shift and played a trump to the ace to discover the 4-0 split.

{
A two-notrump rebid such as East's here should be based not only
on a heart stopper but on solid diamonds. Three diamonds is much
better; with North having raised hearts, South is likely to lead
the HA, letting East score not only the HK but a ruff in dummy.
South doubled on the basis of his extra strength. Remarkably,
West guessed to run to three diamonds on a doubleton, and South
played three hearts.

{
The peculiarities of Smederavac and Wernle's Strong-Club system
got them to an inferior contract. North's one diamond might have
been based on as few as two, South's one spade (very rarely)
on as few as three. Thus neither supported the other's suit,
and they played one notrump on a pair of hands that many others
would play in two spades (or perhaps two diamonds), making two
or three depending on a diamond guess.
