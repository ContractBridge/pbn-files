It's nice to have a way to show two lower-ranking suits with
merely constructive values over partner's major-suit opening,
and Gromoller-Kirmse just happened to have one, East's three-club
jump to show both minors. West, with fine club support and aces
in the majors, put East in the good club game, tough to reach
via the usual methods.

{
Bidding was all on this deal. North's three-diamond preempt posed
a thorny problem for East, with three spades, three notrump and
even a conservative pass all imperfect yet with merit. As it
turns out, three spades would make things easier for West: in
light of the fit, he might be able to ask for keys and reach
the cold grand slam. However, East can't be faulted for bidding
three notrump with a balanced hand, two diamond stoppers and
an ordinary five-card spade suit.

Unwilling to let himself be shut out by East's weak-notrump opening,
North balanced with two clubs, showing majors. East doubled for
the lead, and South gave preference to hearts. East having shown
clubs, South's best plan was clear: a crossruff, with the assurance
that East could not overruff dummy.

{
When South, after passing initially, entered with a "pre-balancing"
double, North competed to four hearts. That could have been doubled
and set three on a crossruff, but East took the push to four
spades. Not satisfied with having pushed his opponents higher
than he thought they could make, North doubled. With stuff in
all plain suits, he planned to lead trumps at every chance, thinking
that most of declarer's tricks would have to come by crossruffing.

Kwiecien's is a nightmare hand for most who play five-card majors
and forcing notrumps (as he and Olanski do), enough to drive
many to Flannery. I'd simply pass this skinny 12-pointer. However,
Kwiecien had an artificial two-club rebid available, and Olanski
landed in the best fit. And what if it weren't? Never fear, East's
helium-like balance took North-South off the hook.

{
One of the possible meanings of West's "Multi" two diamonds was
a balanced 20-22 HCP, and that's what she showed by her two-notrump
rebid over East's "negative for hearts" two-heart response. East's
"Puppet Stayman" three clubs following located the 5-3 spade
fit, and East raised aggressively to game. Pushy, pushy: with
his flat, junky 4-HCP hand East should pass West's two notrump.

{
A one-notrump opening with a six-card minor is a gamble: when
it is good, it is very, very good, and when it is bad, it is
horrid. East's jump to three notrump was aggressive, perhaps
based on overvaluation of his five-card suit with only one honor.
East may also have overrated his ace-doubleton; ace-third is
more valuable, being harder for the defenders to dislodge. Even
if East merely invited, however, West could bid game on the strength
of his club suit.

{
If his methods permitted, East might have done better to start
with an "Unusual Two-Notrump Overcall" than a light, shapely
one heart. Over South's weak distributional three-diamond raise,
West competed to three hearts, for which he had normal values.
Unaccountably, East continued on to game. Didn't he expect bidding
and making three hearts to suffice for a good matchpoint score?|
nt|When in with the DK, East led the S8 and called for dummy's
SK. One discard helping little, he'd have done better to finesse
the S9, playing South for jack-third on the auction; if North
had the SJ, East might still take a ruffing finesse against the
SA later. North took the SA and rightly gave a ruff-and-sluff.
Covering the HJ was understandable: South was unlikely to have
the HK. A club misguess (losing to a singleton CK) put East down
an extra. Down two, plus 100.

{
To North's "Multi" two diamonds (normally a "weak two-bid" in
either major), South responded two spades, positive for hearts
and negative for spades. East and West both being balanced, with
neither long clubs nor a strong hand, South's two spades stole
the pot. Five-card weak twos, like North's here, often produce
bad contracts for the two-bidder's side. On this deal, a pass
by North might lead to a superior heart partscore.

East's "Unusual Two-Notrump Opening" for the minors caught South
without enough strength to enter and warned West that North and
South were on for game in spades. His five-diamond preempt, which
could also have been based on hope of making, prevented the balancing
double that South might have found over three diamonds. Because
West's hand was undefined, neither North nor South could double
five diamonds.
