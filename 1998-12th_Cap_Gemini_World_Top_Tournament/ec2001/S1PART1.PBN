{
The featured pair for the first session of the semi-final are
French stars Paul Chemla and Alain Levy, who won this event two
years ago in Warsaw. They have both won numerous championships,
but usually with different partners. They play five-card majors
and a strong NT. Tutka's 1C was Polish, and had several possibilities,
and Gawecki's 1S was natural. 2D was an artificial game force
and 4C was a splinter. I find it hard to believe that 4NT was
natural, but is easy to see why Gawecki passed it with most of
his points in his partner's short suit.

{
Gawecki's 2NT was invitational in clubs and Levy's double got
his side to the hopeless 4S. Tutka might well have fancied doubling
4S, but before he could express an opinion, Gawecki stuck his
neck out with 5C and promptly got it chopped off. He also lost
a trick in the play when he tried to ruff a heart with the C5,
and the upshot was that Levy made all his trumps and declarer
was three down for plus 500 to our featured pair.

After a typical competitive pairs auction, Chemla was allowed
to play in 3H. Kowalski led the SK, won the second round of trumps
and cashed his two spade tricks. He then played a club to Romanski's
ace. A diamond switch was essential to prevent West from being
endplayed in the suit, and it was duly forthcoming.

{
Chemla could not make a takeout double of Romanski's 1H overcall
as that would have denied four spades, so he had to bid 1S, and
Levy's 1NT rebid ended the auction. Romanski preferred to lead
from his chunkier club suit, so Levy won the first trick with
the CQ. He now played a diamond and received a rude awakening
when East discarded a heart, but he had the consolation of knowing
that the bad diamond break could be a handicap to those pairs
playing in a diamond partscore.

{
Levy's off-center 1NT opening seemed to have lost the heart fit
for his side, but with Chemla holding a hand that was ideal for
using Stayman and then passing partner's response, all was not
yet lost. However, in the French style partner can also respond
2NT to show both majors, so perhaps with that consideration in
mind Chemla passed 1NT.

{
Burn opened a sound weak 2H, and that ended the auction. Since
N/S were likely make at least eight tricks in a NT contract,
one down would be good for E/W and two down good for N/S, but
which would it be? Chemla led a spade and Burn tried a club to
the jack. No joy there. Chemla naturally played a trump and Levy
won and switched to a diamond to the jack, king and ace. Now
Burn tried a club to the king. No joy there either.

{
The South hand did not meet Chemla's criteria for a weak two
bid, but the West hand was acceptable to Salek and he opened
a Multi 2D. Birman enquired with 2NT, and now Chemla came to
life with a brave (?) 3S overcall. Levy was delighted to raise
the ante and the spotlight was on Birman. Since E/W can make
eleven tricks in hearts, his pass turned out badly, but it looks
like a tough decision to me.

Terenzi's 2C showed a 4-4-4-1 hand with a singleton other than
spades. That was a useful gadget to have on this hand as it helped
E/W reach a game that was not always bid. Levy began with the
CA and then switched to the DJ, won by declarer's king. Gergati
cashed the SA and played the ten of hearts to the queen and king
and Chemla erred by taking the ace. Chemla returned a trump and
Gergati won in hand and ruffed a club in dummy.

Levy's 3D was a limit raise in spades with only three-card support.
That was enough for Chemla to go on to game in spades, and Burgay
made a pairs double. He might have regretted that decision if
his partner had begun with ace and another heart, giving declarer
scope for a winning endplay, but Mariani led a diamond, won the
HA and continued diamonds. Chemla crossed to the CA, led a spade
to the queen and a spade back towards dummy. When Mariani showed
out he conceded one down: minus 100.

1NT was 13-15 and Burgay transferred to hearts. Mariani had a
very suitable hand for hearts, so bid 2NT to show a maximum with
four-card support. Burgay However, was not interested and simply
retransferred. It may seem strange that Chemla was not active
during the bidding, but the vulnerability and systemic considerations
probably played their parts.

{
4S is the normal contract for N/S and the French pair got there
in two bids. De Giacomi led the DK and Levy won the ace and continued
the suit, laying the groundwork for a diamond ruff in case trumps
were not 2-2. But of course everything was as sweet as possible
- trumps were 2-2, the CK was onside and clubs broke 3-3. So
Levy hardly broke sweat in making the obvious twelve tricks when
East continued with the HK.

East's 2D showed five spades and four hearts, and after Levy's

a spade stopper, or perhaps 3S with a half stopper - all depending
on this pair's agreements - the right contract would be reached.
By bidding 3NT himself, Chemla would have gambled on either a
spade honor, or long and good enough clubs and/or good diamonds
in North. However, North could not cooperate and 5C was reached.
