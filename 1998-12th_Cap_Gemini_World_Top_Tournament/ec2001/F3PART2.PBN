{
North's 2C opening showed long clubs in a limited hand. East
doubled and bid her hearts after South competed in clubs and
West passed. West now felt justified in raising to game, but
East's slam try, the 5C cuebid, pushed the partnership overboard.

Simple no frills power bidding, but including a 1NT forcing response,
got N/S to their best spot, 3NT. Declarer started with nine obvious
tricks, and he ended with those same tricks. 3NT made three,

{
It was just as well that East just couldn't manage to find a
raise to 2S, for West might well have jumped to game. As it was,
he bid 3S all by himself, although the optimum result for his
side would have been to double 3D for a one-trick set (difficult
defense requiring West not to lead a top spade or a heart). North
cashed the DK on opening lead before shifting to trumps to remove
a dummy entry, there was an alternative.

[Declarer "N"]
{
South opened with a Multi 2D to show (amongst other possibilities)
a weak two in either major. North inquired with 2NT and jumped
to 6S when South indicated a maximum with spades and a heart
control. The Spanish East doubled for penalties, little suspecting
that the only lead to beat the contract was a heart, and not
a diamond. 6S doubled made six, plus 1210 for N/S.

{
Despite holding a five-card trump suit and prime values, North
showed admirable restraint when he declined his partner's game
invitation. East, who was so badly burnt on the previous board,
again made the wrong choice after winning the opening lead with
the DA. He shifted to a low spade, rather than a club, apparently
hoping to create two defensive spade tricks.

The auction to 3NT was routine. East selected the S8 for his

lost but, with both the D10 and SJ dropping, declarer took twelve
tricks anyway. 3NT made six, plus 690 for N/S.

[Declarer "E"]
{
East's 1NT showed 14-16 HCP and West's 2S over South's double
(5-4 with at least one major) indicated some values but was not
forcing. Martens, South, understandably thinking it might still
be 'our' deal, bid 3C. This gave West an opportunity to introduce
his second suit, whereupon East reassessed his hand and called
3NT. 3NT can always be made, for declarer can get dummy's diamonds
going as South, void in spades, can't remove dummy's entry.

{
West's decision to open the bidding with 1H rather than 4H allowed
the partnership to end up in 3NT, the optimal spot. Notice that
a N/S sacrifice in 4S would have payed off, or at least have
pushed E/W to the five level with no further consequence, except
that West might well have chosen to play in hearts rather than
notrump.

{
Sometimes technology cannot handle scientific bidding, like the
nine rounds of bidding on this deal. The auction started off
with Pass(West) - 1C(strong) - Pass - 1S - Pass - 2NT - Pass
- 3C(South). The remainder of the auction was as shown in the
bidding diagram. East unleashed a Lightner double (as if West
would not have found the club lead himself), and North thought
it prudent to retreat to 6NT, doubled by West this time, though
more for pride than for profit as events will show.

{
After passing as dealer, North bid 2C, Drury, to show a limit
raise in spades, and South accepted the game invitation. Declarer
won the heart opening lead, and not counting on the clubs to
run, ruffed a heart before playing trumps. West won her SA and
wisely decided to collect any diamond tricks her side might be
entitled to.

As E/W's 1NT range was 14-16 HCP, West had no reason to disturb
that contract. It would be interesting to see how many E/W pairs
playing 15-17 notrumps managed to avoid the 'notrumps at pairs'
syndrome to end in a club partial, the top spot, for ten tricks
are easy in clubs.
