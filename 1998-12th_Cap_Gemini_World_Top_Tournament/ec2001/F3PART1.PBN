{
The featured pair are the Poles Marcin Lesniewski and Krzysztof
Martens. They play the Polish club and are lying in fourth place
halfway through the final. Van Cleef had a classic hand for using
Stayman over 1NT and then passing partner's response, and when
he duly adopted this approach E/W landed in their 4-4 diamond
fit. Martens led his singleton spade and Van Der Neut misguessed
by rising with the king on the second round. Martens ruffed and
followed his partner's suit-preference signal by underleading
the CA.

{
Opinions will probably vary as to whether you should double 2C
with the North hand to keep hearts in the picture for your side,
or raise the level in diamonds to keep spades out of the picture
for the opponents. Lesniewski opted for the former, and then
supported diamonds on the next round. Clearly the defense can
take five tricks against 3D on a heart lead, but Van Cleeff was
not clairvoyant and he led a small spade.

2C was artificial and 2D a relay, a method apparently designed
to allow South to distinguish between a three-card spade raise
and a four-card spade raise; however, North bid game regardless.
Kowalczyk began with three rounds of diamonds and Lesniewski
ruffed the third round.

{
East's opening 2C bid was either a weak two in diamonds or a
balanced 22-23, and the 2NT rebid showed the latter. 3C was Puppet
Stayman and 3D denied a five-card major but showed at least one
four-card major. The 4D continuation now showed both majors,
so the strong hand got to play 4S, which was the object of the
exercise. Martens led a heart, so Kroes won in hand and cashed
two top trumps.

{
Martens' sequence showed a weak NT, and Lesniewski judged to
remove to 2S. Kroes led the S10 and Lesniewski played low in
dummy. There was little point in rising with the SA and discarding
a heart on a diamond, as he would just lose an extra club trick
instead (the defenders would play two rounds of trumps). Harings
took the SK and returned a trump to cut down club ruffs in dummy,
and Lesniewski immediately played three rounds of diamonds to
discard a heart.

{
Martens had an impeccable 3D opening bid and Lesniewski had the
right mix of offence and defence to raise to the four level.
Zurakowski responded 4S to his partner's takeout double, but
when that came round to Martens he broke with conventional wisdom
by bidding again. That was the correct decision, as 5D was cold,
but Cichocki naturally went on to 5S. Lesniewski led the HA and
Zurakowski falsecarded with the nine. To make the contract as
the cards lay, declarer needed to pick up the hearts, for a club
discard, and finesse the CQ.

A simple hand for a change. Either Cichocki was not playing Namyats,
or he chose not to use it third in hand, as he opened a heavy
4H. That ended the auction, and the play didn't take much longer.
Martens cashed his CAK and switched to a diamond. Declarer ruffed,
drew trumps and claimed. Plus 450, and an almost certain average

{
Lesniewski's 1C opening bid was Polish and the 1D response was
either a negative (0-6) or a variety of stronger hands. E/W now
got involved in the auction, but that probably helped N/S rather
than hindered them. North's double of 2S showed a good hand and
South's 3S showed any splinter. Lesniewski now signed off in
5C, expecting there to be two aces missing, but Martens went
on to 6C because of his diamond void. Sin cashed the SA, but
that was the only trick for the defense. Plus 920 to N/S.

[Contract "1NT"]
[Declarer "W"]
{
Hagen's 1NT opening was systemically acceptable as it was allowed
to contain a six-card suit, but it still seems a remarkable decision
to open that hand with 1NT. No one saw fit to disturb that contract,
and Lesniewski led the C6. Hagen guessed correctly when he rose
with dummy's CQ at trick one, and he guessed correctly at trick
two as well when he played a heart and finessed the ten. That
produced ten tricks and plus 180 to E/W - a dreadful result for
N/S.

{
Pairs playing a forcing 1NT response will doubtless reach the
superior 2H contract, but Lesniewski had to play in 1NT. With
West able to hold up the HA, prospects were bleak and the contract
was likely to go two down, but Moszynski made the friendly lead
of the CJ. That was covered by the king and ace and Cieslak naturally
continued with the C9 taken by declarer's queen. Lesniewski could
now establish a second club trick while he still had an entry
to cash it, but, perhaps fearing a consequent loss of tempo,
he played on hearts instead.

{
2C was natural or a strong hand and 2D enquired. The 2S response
showed that 2C was natural, but the sequence must have promised
extra values to justify East's jump to game. Lesniewski led a
trump and Martens won and switched to diamonds, but with trumps
three-three and hearts behaving there was nothing to the play.
Cieslak made four spades, five hearts and a club for ten tricks.
Plus 420 and a very good result for Cieslak and Moszynski, who
were leading the field at this stage.

Another straightforward hand. 3NT was the obvious contract and
there were exactly nine tricks available - two spades, three
hearts, three diamonds and a club. The only point of interest
was that Lesniewski threw his DQ under declarer's king in a vain
attempt to create an entry to his partner's hand so that he could

The Norwegian E/W stopped in 3H after West had shown a limit
raise with three-card support via a forcing 1NT response to East's
1H opening bid. West had indeed raised to the limit when (not
unexpectedly) it transpired at Trick One that the SK was offside.
Declarer lost a further two diamond tricks at tricks two and
three, and there was an inescapable loser in trumps. Thus, he
claimed 3H making 3, minus 140 for NS. [Your host for the rest

and South, holding limited values that included two nice aces
and three-card support for both minors, competed with 3C, asking
North to pass if he also held clubs, or correct otherwise. West
felt he held enough to bid 3S. That contract can easily be set
two tricks unless the defense leads clubs.
