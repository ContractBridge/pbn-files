{
OR - With only one match left after this, the Dutch are in third
place and the Austrians are just clinging to 5th - the last qualifying
spot for Bali. The first deal is a slam on a finesse. The Dutch
showed no interest beyond game, Simons raised her partner's 1H
opening to 4H. Although Pasman has good controls, her balanced
hand looks trickless outside her top winners and she has a routine
pass. With the CA offside, 11 tricks were the limit: NS plus
450. (You host for this match is Marc Smith)

{
CR - The Austrians investigated the hand a little further. Fisher
opened a Blue-style strong club and Weigkricht's 1H showed a
positive with less than three Neapolitan controls (A=2, K=1).
2H was natural and now Weigkricht splintered, but Fischer knew
they were missing either the CA or both black kings. The problem
was that Weigkricht would have bid the same way with the SK and
CK-Q. Stopping at 4H was tougher here than at the other table,
but Fischer did the right thing. Push Board.

OR - The Dutch play sound 2/1 responses, and this North hand
did not qualify. Simon's 2S rebid showed at least a 6-card suit,
so although Pasman knew that clubs might be a better spot, she
had no guarantees. Simons set about ruffing hearts immediately
and eventually scored all three of her low trumps to go with
two hearts and the CA. The A-Q-J of trumps were sure to be worth
two tricks: NS plus 110.

CR - Fischer responded at the 2-level and rebid a non-forcing
3C. With a shapeless minimum, the raise looks too optimistic
as does Fischer's acceptance when some of South's hand is surely
wasted in spades. When she scored trick one with the H8, declarer
had a chance, although Van der Pas clearly should have covered
with HQ. In the end position, Fischer played for diamonds to
have been 4-4 initially. Had she laid down the CA first, East
king dropping would have ensured declarer two of the last three
tricks. NS minus 50; 4 IMPs to Netherlands.

catch-all 1D opening, East has a marginal negative double at
best. Erhart chose to pass and could do little but pass again
when South's pre-emptive raise to 3S came back to her. Terraneo
won the club lead and switched to a diamond, not wishing to set
up declarer's CQ if she had three. Erhart won the DK and returned
the suit when a heart switch was needed. Now declarer was able
to draw trumps and take a second diamond finesse for a club discard
and nine tricks. NS plus 140.

and partial heart fit with a double. Vriend has a close decision

ten tricks: EW plus 620. 13 IMPs to Netherlands. The Dutch lead

OR - It looks tempting to pass 1S on that South hand, but Simons
elected soldier on with 1NT. This was not a thing of beauty,
but West's club lead gave declarer three tricks in that suit.
She attacked spades, taking two losing finesses to East's honors,
and West played a third spade when she won the HA, forcing declarer
to cash her black-suit winners. In the endgame, declarer cashed
HQ for her sixth trick and exited in hearts. West had everything
and could not get out of her own way. A rather fortunate plus
90 for NS.

With trumps 3-3, the SA onside, and the CJ coming down doubleton,
she could have made the contract by winning the second spade
and playing on trumps. Instead, though, declarer played to ruff
diamonds and thus enabled North to score the H9 on the fourth
round of the suit. One down: EW minus 50 but 1 IMP to Netherlands.

eight tricks in hearts) and Van der Pas had no ambitions beyond
game with an ace-less hand. South never got into the auction,
so we'll never know if the Dutch EW would have collected the
maximum from 5D-X. Van der Pas scored an overtrick when a diamond

OR - The natural 1D opening perhaps deterred Terraneo from pre-empting
with 3C on the West cards, and that probably earned her side
a game swing. Erhart led a trump against 4H and, when that suit
split 4-0, Pasman elected to try guessing spades immediately.
Predictably, she guessed wrong, but even if she had delayed she
could never have discovered that clubs were 7-2, so she would
probably have played West for the spade length and, hence, the
queen anyway. One down: NS minus 100.

pre-emptive 3S overcall made things very tough for Simons, who
showed her slam interest with a 4S cue-bid. When Pasman simply
rebid 5D, though, Simons had discovered little as she was looking
at the A-K of the only suit her partner could have cue-bid. This
would be a good hand on which to play 5D/4NT as good and bad
5D bids, since Blackwood is rarely useful in this position. Simons
guessed to raise to the slam. Unlucky - partner has the wrong
spade honor and only 1 HCP in diamonds. NS minus 50.

OR - Al Roth would not approve of Erhart's vulnerable 1H opening,
but that's what the system says is the right opening bid. What
id doesn't tell you is what to do after South overcalls 3D. I
guess West's negative double is okay, because she has the safety
of the heart fit. What a horrid problem Erhart faced, though
- would you want to REBID that heart suit?!?! Her actual choice
of 3S escaped a double from Pasman, who probably thought her
heart honors were poorly placed! No doubt Erhart was delighted
to escape for minus 200 on the board.

assume that it showed some kind of good 3D overcall. That being
the case, surely either North or South should compete further
over 3C...? The defenders found one spade ruff, but Weigkricht
could not be sufficiently sure of her partner's suit-preference
signal to underlead her DA at trick four to score a second ruff,
which would have flattened the deal. EW minus 100. 3 IMPs to

through the vagaries of system. The natural Dutch auction was
straightforward. So too was Erhart's heart lead. Declarer can
make the contract double dummy - win HK and play a spade to the
king. When that holds, switch to diamonds. The defenders can
take three spade tricks and the DA, but no more. Having no clue
which ace was East's entry though, Pasman naturally started diamonds
at trick two. Thus West was able to clear the hearts while East

{
CR - The Dutch did very well to play the hand from the East seat,
as only an unlikely singleton spade lead does not immediately
give the twelfth trick. Not that finding a safe opening lead
from the North seat against 6S is so easy - a heart that might
or might not be away from the king is probably best but declarer
can still get home with the clubs lying so favorably. EW plus
1440 and 15 IMPs from nowhere to the Dutch. Netherlands by 16:
56-40.

{
OR - West opened with a natural and limited 2C. Erhart eventually
made a slam try with 4C, but quickly signed off when her partner
failed to cue-bid in diamonds. With the diamonds 4-4, EW are
destined to make game whether they play in clubs, spades or notrumps.
EW plus 600.

{
CR - The Dutch also bid efficiently to the best game. The diamond
held the contract to 11 tricks here too: EW plus 600. Push Board.
The Dutch win the match by 16 IMPs, 56-40 (18-12 in VPs) in what
has truly been a game of three thirds, with the Dutch enjoying
two of the three segments in which one side or other piled up
a large number of IMPs.
