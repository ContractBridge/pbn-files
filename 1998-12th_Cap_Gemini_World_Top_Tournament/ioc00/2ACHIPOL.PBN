{
OR - Is North worth a passed hand protective double? Chuangcheng
Ju thought so. His partner Zhong Fu, South, must have been pleased
with the developments and passed, hoping for blood. Opposite
a random preempt it may be right to run with the West hand, but
Piotr Tuszynski, East, is a solid player, so Krzysztof Jassem,
West, wasn't really tempted. East won the club lead in hand,
took a diamond finesse and gave up a spade. He later managed
four minor suit winners, two ruffs and two trump tricks for eight
tricks; plus 470, a good start for Poland.

{
CR - Here, the auction started in the same way as at the other
table, but since Xueling Cao, East, may have had only five hearts,
Lixin Yang, West, redoubled for rescue. That led to 3C doubled,
and on the marked trump lead, East could win in hand, finesse
in diamonds, ruff out the suit and play two rounds of trumps.
When they broke 4-2, as expected he led high diamonds to hold
the loss to one down. Plus 100 NS, 11 Polish IMPs. One deal proves
nothing but this one reveals a subtle downside for popular undisciplined
preempts!

3C to 3D. North showed his values with a redouble, but nobody
felt inclined to bid again when East scrambled to 2S. Tuszynski
did well in the play, developing diamonds and keeping control.

CR - Facing a passed partner, Yang didn't mind having a four-card
major on the side for his weak jump overcall. The bid worked
very well. Not having a negative free bid available, Pszczola
risked a sputnik double. This pushed his side into a very uncomfortable
contract. Although Kwiecien made a nice effort in the heart suit,
the 4-1 break was too much to overcome. When the CA turned out
to be offside, the roof fell in: minus 300.

Jassem's apparently odd choice of 2H. Tuszynski simply forgot
their method. It can happen to anyone. The CQ was led against
this undignified contract, and declarer attempted to score as
many tricks as possible. He ducked a spade, and won the heart
shift with dummy's ace. A spade to the ace, and the DQ was covered
by the king and ace. Declarer successfully played a diamond to
his ten (South pitching a spade), but that was all. Down three,

fit. The D6 went to the king and ace. East switched to the SJ,
queen . . . ace. Unfortunately, this ended the defence's chances
to defeat the contract. West had to duck the first round of spades
to maintain communication for the delayed spade ruff. Here, when
East came in with the HA, he had no way to West's hand for the
ruff. Making three; plus 140 to NS, and 4 imps to China where

diamonds breaking declarer had nine top tricks, but Tuszynski
did a lot better. He ducked the ace of clubs twice to cut communications.

long spades provide the vital club discards. A good illustration
of the "well-known" fact that a 4-4 fit sometimes is superior
to a 5-4 or 6-4 fit. But how do you reach it? When South bid

{
OR - 1C was forcing, either with a balanced 12-15 hand or any
strong hand, and 1S showed 8+ HCPs and 4+ spades. At that point,
West could have used an artificial 2D bid (game-force, 3+ spades)
to learn more about East's hand, but with his semi-balanced hand
and lots of losers, he preferred a descriptive raise to 4S instead.
A heart lead, ducked to the king, and a low diamond back, may
have defeated the contract, but on the actual diamond lead, East
had ten easy tricks; plus 620 EW.

{
CR - After a strong 1C (16+ HCP) and a weak 1D (0-8 HCPs), South
could introduce his diamonds at a relatively safe level, and
now the spade game was played the other way around. North led
a trump and won his HK three tricks later. A low diamond return
then would probably have led to defeat, but thinking South had
both the queen and the jack of diamonds, North led a club. Plus
620 EW, for a push. A missed chance, no doubt.

{
OR - 2S was a transfer overcall and Tuszynski later decided to
show his second suit as well, a pretty aggressive approach. The
play in the "Moysian" fit was uncomfortable, but declarer managed
to take seven tricks. Minus 300 was no triumph, however.

{
CR - In third seat Pszczola chose to open his short suit for
lead-directing purposes. East was able to show his second suit
at the two level and West naturally preferred to play in clubs.
Cao should have done a trick better in the play. The loss of
three spade tricks could have been avoided, for instance by not
playing the ace at trick ten. Down two; minus 100. 5 IMPs to
China.

{
R - Tuszynski, East, doubled Ju's 13-15 notrump to show strength,
and then balanced with 2S over Fu's retreat to 2H. Fu led the
C7, and declarer took North's ten with his ace, and emerged with
. . . the HQ! No one plays the HQ from an AQ combination like
that thought Fu - and he ducked the HQ. Declarer could now ruff
a heart in dummy, and pick up the trump suit. He emerged with
five spades, two hearts, a heart ruff and a club for nine tricks.
Plus 140 to EW.

{
CR - When Kwiecien, South, bid and rebid his hearts, Pszczola
thought enough of his hand to compete to the three level over
Cao's 2S. A spade was led to the jack, and East shifted to a
low heart. Declarer ran this to his jack, and played the SQ to
East's SK. Ace and another heart left declarer with a successful
negotiation of the diamond suit for his ninth trick. When this
proved to be an easy task, he had his nine tricks for +140 to
NS. A useful team effort from both Polish pairs brought them
7 IMPs. At the half, Poland was 8 IMPs ahead of China, 23-15.
