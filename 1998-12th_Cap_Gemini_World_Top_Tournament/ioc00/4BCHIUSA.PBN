{
OR - OR - Soloway's double of Ju's 13-15 1NT in the balancing
seat showed a two-suiter, hearts and a minor. He didn't have
to be nearly as strong as he was, so when Hamman showed a heart
preference, Soloway tried for game with a descriptive raise to
3H suggesting six hearts). Assured about the trump suit, Hamman
had an easy raise. Fu found the good trump lead, but Hamman only
needed one club ruff to make his contract. In the ending, South's
S10 saved North from being squeezed for an overtrick: plus 620.

{
CR - Rodwell's catchall 1D opening was passed around to Yang,
who was too strong for a balancing 1H and so doubled instead.
His next bid of 2H showed a very strong hand, so Cao, looking
at two aces and prime heart support, issued a slam try with a
4D cue-bid. Although he didn't have a diamond control, there
were no other unambiguous actions available to him; most expert
partnerships treat below-game cue-bids as value-showing rather
than control-showing. After a trump lead, Yang also took ten
tricks, for plus 620 and a push.

OR - Good players hate to trap pass at the one level; they would
rather make a bid when there is one available. Soloway duly overcalled
1NT here. The spade lead and continuation (ducked by Ju) did
not hurt declarer. Note the way Soloway played the diamond suit.
Without the eight in West it's the only way to pick up king-fourth
in South (with the actual holding you can also start with the
jack and unblock the ten from hand). Eight tricks: plus 120.

CR - Here South opened a 13-15 1NT. West might have overcalled
2H, but that was far from safe on such a mediocre suit. When
North transferred to spades Yang might have risked a takeout
double in the "live" auction, but he chose to remain silent.
This proved to be a good decision, as 2S stood no chance. Declarer
did well to hold his losses to three diamonds, two spades, a
heart and a club. Minus 100: 1 IMP to USA.

OR - A very good 6C slam available to EW. In response to Soloway's
classic weak-two-bid in hearts, Hamman closed the auction with
a jump to 3NT. A 2NT advance would have been Ogust (not a feature
ask), so wouldn't have located the important CK. A natural forcing
3C may have elicited a raise to 4C, pointing towards the club
slam. In 3NT, Hamman won the diamond lead and led a heart to
the king and ace, settling for eleven tricks when spades behaved:

no strength-showing double available and chose 2S, showing spades

had, but trying for game opposite a balancing partner is seldom
a good thing to do, so he passed - and missed a decent 4S. Soloway

and Yang returned the suit himself to the ten, king, and ace.
Declarer can be held to three tricks from here, but Meckstroth
couldn't know Rodwell had both the SJ and S10, so he led back
a low spade to simplify the defense. Yang could have cashed out
for three down, but ran the D10, trying for a make. Ouch! Down

OR - Fu chose to treat his hand as a balanced 13-15, and Ju raised
to game. On a spade lead, Fu needed diamonds three-two with the
king onside plus a guess (finesse in clubs or in hearts?). The
DK was in place, but the suit didn't break, and when the CK wasn't
singleton, Fu had to go one down: minus 50.

{
CR - Meckwell's 1NT opening non-vulnerable in 1st or 2nd seat
is 9-12 HCP, so Meckstroth was too strong for it, chosing a nebulous
1D instead. When West entered the bidding, vulnerable (with a
bad hand opposite a passed partner) and Cao had just the right
type of hand for a preemptive jump raise, the Americans allowed
themselves to be shut out. Rodwell led the H3 and Meckstroth
judged correctly to win and switch to the CQ, so the result was
two down. Even better would have been to double, but a plus (200)
is a plus. 6 IMPs to USA, 48-35.

{
OR - East had an obvious 2H bid in balancing seat. Because NS
had stopped in 1NT he knew his partner would have some values.
West might have passed 2H, but East could have had a better hand
and Soloway did not want to miss a vulnerable game. To defeat
3H South had to play a diamond when in with the king of hearts.
This looks difficult, but in view of dummy's spades Fu might
have found this defense. When he didn't declarer could set up
a third spade trick for a diamond discard.

CR - The 2D balancing showed a major onesuiter. This made West
the declarer in 3H. North had a natural diamond lead and Meckstroth
duly led one. NS stayed away from the spade suit and the contract
duly went one down. A useful 6 imp swing to the USA.

{
OR - Soloway's 14-16 HCPnotrump concluded the auction. The H2
was taken by dummy's queen (South playing the jack), and a spade
was ducked to North's king (attempting to avoid being end-played).
The H6 went to the ten and ace. When declarer exited with the
S3, North's far-sightedness was rewarded; he played the nine
and Fu won the jack to return the C9 in case of any club end-plays.
Although Fu was taking care of his partner, his thoughtfulness
cost a trick. Declarer had two spades, two hearts and four clubs
for plus 120.

{
CR - Yang downgraded his hand as it contained "aces and spaces",
and opened a 13-15 HCP NT. When was the last time an aggressive
player followed that course? Here Meckstroth followed to the
first heart with the three and Rodwell won the first spade with
the nine. Yang ducked the second heart, won the third, and ducked
a spade to North, who cashed his heart. Rodwell switched to the
D5, but when Meckstroth won the DA he returned a club, so Yang
took the rest for plus 120. No swing. USA defeated China by 15
IMPs, 50 to 35.
