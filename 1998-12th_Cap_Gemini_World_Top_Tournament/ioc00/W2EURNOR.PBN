{
OR - An easy slam was missed. While it is true that Nemhmert,
South, probaly was not to thrilled with Rauscheid's bidding and
rebidding hearts, she did not give North an opportunity to show
her considerable extra features by jumping to game over 4C in
an already gameforcing auction. Lacking 3 key cards, North was
apparently reluctant to commit the partnership to slam, though
she no doubt had an uncomfortable feeling that she could easily
have enough to make slam an excellent prospect. Plus 620 to NS.

{
CR - The North Americans in the closed room, having to stage
a comeback, had their chances here, but they did not even sniff
at slam. This is all the more incomprehensible because they were
playing 2-over-1 gameforcing. Thus, North's jump rebid unnecessarily
crowded the auction, and South was reluctant to move beyond 3NT
for fear of a (partial) misfit (North's shape might well have
been 3-6-1-3). After a spade lead, there were only 9 tricks,
and so, Europe picked up another imp where they might have lost
13.

[Declarer "W"]
{
OR - The 1NT response was forcing and presumably 3C was constructive
after East's 2NT rebid (why not 2H?). From the EW convention
card it's not clear what West should bid holding a weak minor
single-suiter (they play splinter raises and 3C gameforcing over
1 of a major). However, the optimal contract was reached, and
when declarer avoided putting up the DK at trick one, there suddenly
were 9 tricks for the taking. Plus 400 to EW.

[Declarer "N"]
{
CR - At this table, North's rather anemic 2D overcall bought
the contract when both East and West took a conservative view.
East might easily have doubled competitively and then West would
gladly have left the double in. Assuming EW did not have a game
somewhere, even the double backfiring would not be disastrous.
There was a game however, and EW collected only 100 points for
a 7 imp loss.

[Declarer "S"]
{
OR - NS's 14-16 notrump range might explain North's slightly
conservative pass at this vulnerabilty after transerring to 2H.
With trumps breaking, there were 8 tricks. However, not counting
on a 3-3 heart break, declarer tried to establish a club trick,
and this led to a defensive club ruff but resolved the trump
situation. When in with the SJ, West erred by returning the D10
(establishing declarer's 9-spot) while exiting with the SK would
have been safe as South had no entry left. Plus 140 to NS.

{
CR - A normal standard auction led to a normal contract, though
the result was slightly inflated. Declarer was lucky to find
hearts 3-3, not to mention East's return of the DK after being
allowed to hold the spade Queen at trick 2. Note: South can't
afford the DA at trick 1 to preserve a late diamond entry if
the 5th heart needs establishing; with tenuous black-suit holdings,
discards on the 3rd and 4th round of hearts would be embarrassing;
the defense might establish enough tricks to set the contract.
Plus 150 for no swing.

{
OR - West's 3D bid at this vulnerability may not be everybody's
cup of tea. The key play for the defense occurred at trick 2,
when declarer's diamond 10 was allowed to hold, killing the suit.
Though the subsequent heart return by South after cashing her
top spades gave declarer another lease on life, she misguessed
clubs knowing that South had 3 clubs at most and North 4 clubs
at least. Pity. The result was 1 down; plus 100 to NS.

South stretched with 2H and North compounded this with 2NT rather
than retreating to 2S, not a very good contact, West might have
tried 3D anyway. Following a diamond lead, the 2NT contract went

{
OR - After an artificial and strong 2C by North, East tried CRASH,
showing two suits of equal color. West, no doubt, hoped to limit
the damage by passing (if East held the black suits, there's
no problem). Had East shifted to hearts after cashing the diamond
Ace, declarer would have been held to her contract, for +180,
losing 2 diamonds, 2 hearts and 1 club trick. Lack of dummy entries
prevents her from picking up the trumps. When East continued
with a LOW diamond at trick 2, North had no trouble making 2
overtricks for plus 380.*)

{
OR - South won the heart lead against 3NT, and crossed to hand
in hearts in order to attack diamonds. When an honor appeared,
the road to 9 tricks was easy. After the defenders had estabished
a second spade winner, declarer could no longer afford to take
the club finesse for an overtrick. Plus 400 to NS.

{
CR - The contract was the same here, but North was declarer.
The difference was that the defense gained a tempo by attacking
spades. But when that suit broke 4-4, declarer lost only 2 spades
and 2 diamonds after similar play. Plus 400 to NS and no swing.

{
OR - Disaster occured in this room when West, holding diamond
length, passed after East had doubled to show a strong hand.
Declarer managed to develop a second club trick and made her
doubled contract. Had West covered the second club however, declarer
plays a spade to the Jack and Queen. West must win to block the
suit and return a diamond to knock out the dummy entry. Now,
South still has 2 diamond losers and will go 1 down. Plus 670
to NS.

{
OR - On the last board of the set, Europe won the partscore battle
when EW failed to compete despite 2 opportunities to do so: over
1D, and over 2D. The 2D contract eaily made with an overtrick
when the trumps couldn't have behaved in a friendlier fashion.
2H by EW is making, but perhaps South would have bid 3D anyway.
Plus 110 to NS.

CR - The closed room EW were not as timid and went straight to
3H, which  was destined to fail by 1 trick. Whether EW would
have bought the contract at 2H is an open question, however.
Still, Europe picked up 2 more imps, and now, at the halfway
point of the match, the lead was 85-9 imps with 24 boards to
go in this match.
