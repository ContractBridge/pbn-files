{
R - Had Duboin known that Bocchi held four aces, he would have
taken a slower route opposite the five-card 1S opening, because
if Duboin's singleton had been in clubs instead, slam would be
an excellent bet. Here, it needed trumps 2-1 with the king onside,
so 4S was where you wanted to be. When the trump finesse lost,
Pszczola shifted to a low club, and Kwiecen didn't put up his
king. A most unlikely second overtrick. Plus 480.

{
CR - Tuszynski's 1S showed at least five cards, just as in the
Open room, but it was also limited to 18 HCP, so the chances
for slam were even smaller here. Jassem simply jumped to 4S,
hoping to make it, to shut out a good save or to sacrifice as
cheaply as possible. At this table, E/W managed to get their
club trick, so it was only one overtrick. Plus 450; 1 IMP to
Italy, now leading 51.5 to 45.

{
OR - The forcing 1NT response pushed EW to 2NT by force. The
standard lead from North's diamond holding is the ten, but especially
without a side entry Bocchi's choice of a small one seems reasonable,
if unsuccessful. Kwiecien won the D7 and returned the suit. Bocchi
took the next diamond and played the HJ. Kwiecien ducked and
Duboin overtook to play a club, but it was too late. Kwiecien
set up his fourth heart for his eighth trick: plus 120.

low diamond was led and although Tuszynski ducked the second
diamond, he switched to hearts when Versace came to hand in clubs
to continue diamonds. Declarer had time for the long heart and
so took eight tricks: plus 120 for a push.

East led the D6 against 3NT, and dummy's queen won. Tuszynski
played HA, HK, H2 to the J. Lauria found a good switch to the
C5, ducked to the K, and Versace's switch to the S6 ran around
to the Q. Declarer cashed all but one heart, and played a spade
to the 10 when East discarded a spade and a diamond. East couldn't
escape the endplay in clubs, and declarer scrambled nine tricks:
plus 400. 1 IMP to Italy, 52.5-45. Had Versace continued clubs,
declarer would have endplayed him in that suit instead. [DC]

{
OR - West doesn't have much, but with four trumps and a fitting
spade honor, he must have been tempted to raise to 3H. And if
East has the CK instead of the CQ, 4H is cold on the actual layout.
But here, a raise only gets a pass and a scary contract. When
the defenders failed to cash their three club tricks in time,
Pszczola could get rid of two clubs from dummy, ending with nine
tricks: plus 140. Do you think Duboin would have found the club
shift against 3H

a spectacular king of spades in search of a ruff, but had no
luck this time. With no entry to his hand (and the HK very likely
offside) declarer just played trumps from dummy. He lost the
obvious four tricks for plus 140.

CR - Versace didn't have a card-showing double available, but
he could have tried 2C to show both majors. Instead he sensibly
chose to go quietly, probably hoping for a couple of vulnerable
undertricks. East led a high heart and declarer cashed his clubs
when he won the HK. He tried to sneak a diamond past Versace,
but he went in with the ace to finish the hearts, and a spade
through the king set the contract. One down: minus 100. 1 IMP
to Poland, 5.5 IMPs behind with seven boards to play.

{
OR - There are some flaws to the 3S preempt: an "ace-empty" suit,
the side four-card suit, and a side void. The vulnerability and
the chance to jam the action make the preempt fairly attractive
nonetheless, and Duboin let the positives sway him. Duboin raised
to 4S, unaware that a cold slam in clubs was available (albeit
on a combined 22 HCP). West led the DJ (Rusinow) to dummy's ace,
and declarer played ace and a spade. When West discarded the
CJ, declarer claimed his ten top tricks, losing only the three
trump tricks: plus 420.

{
CR - Jassem was surely thinking the same thoughts about pros
and cons, and also emerged with 3S. Here, however, Versace overcalled
4H, relying on the theory that the hand with shortness in the
preemptor's suit should act aggressively. When Tuszynski doubled
for penalty, Versace must have felt a little queasy about his
bid . . . until he saw partner's marvelous dummy. Grazie, Lorenzo!
There were only four tricks available to the defense, and declarer

{
OR - East has a difficult hand to value over West's 2D rebid.
Pszczola wanted to do something, but knew that his partner had
a minimum opening with less than four clubs and (usually) less
than three hearts. Was it likely that 3C would lead to a making
game, or would it get them overboard? Pszczola chose the conservative
pass, but when Kwiecien atypically had all his strength outside
diamonds, they missed a good 4H. On the spade lead, declarer
ruffed one spade in dummy and discarded the other on a high heart,
losing three trumps: plus 130.

the opponents. This deal shows that it's often the other way
around. Tuszynski's takeout double on 12 HCP with 7 of them in
opener's suit, 4-3-3-3, vulnerable, opposite a passed partner,
got what it deserved. Not to mention the raise to 2S! Had he
passed over 2D, Lauria may well have passed too, but here Lauria
was more or less forced to act, and Versace made a nice (but
obvious) jump to 4H. Eleven easy tricks: plus 650. 11 well-deserved

OR - Third hand non-vulnerable it was too tempting for East to
open 3D. 4C showed a diamond fit with values in clubs. Its aim
was to let East in on the decision whether or not to save over
four-of-a-major. Bocchi didn't want to excite his partner, so
he waited a round before bidding 4H. As the Poles lead low from
doubletons East's C6 could have been from 96. Kwiecien followed
low, and although Bocchi had his ace of clubs ruffed out when
he attacked spades first, it didn't hurt him; he still made eleven
tricks. A nice plus 450.

an exchange of cue-bids (5S looks like a real stretch), the partnership
assayed the heart slam. If the CA had been onside (not too likely
after the overcall), or the J10x of diamonds had fallen, the
slam would have come home. Lauria was never in danger of leading
his CA, so the slam was due to fail. The SJ was led, and declarer

{
OR - 2C showed at least 4-4 in the majors and 4-10 HCP. Kwiecien
had a difficult hand and jumped straight to 5C. Pszczola must
have had serious thoughts about raising to slam, so Bocchi's
(stupid) double was a surprise. When that ended the bidding,
Kwiecen quickly claimed all 13 tricks: plus 1150. Not as good
as slam, but better than letting the opponents play the hand.

{
CR - 1C could have been a balanced hand with 2-3 clubs, so Lauria
couldn't raise immediately. However, when Versace jumped to 4H
when 3H would have shown a great hand with at least 5-6 distribution,
anything less than 6C would have been a mistake (and a 5D cue-bid
would have been even better). Jassem, knowing about the double
fit, saved in 6D, and Versace, afraid of a diamond loser, doubled.
Lauria alertly led a spade for Versace to ruff, and then there
were three red-suit tricks to cash. Three down: minus 800, but
8 IMPs to Poland.

{
OR - Bocchi-Duboin play transfer responses to one-of-a-minor,
so 1H showed spades. After the game-forcing 3C Duboin asked for
a heart stopper with 3H. When Bocchi couldn't provide one Duboin
probably suspected there were three major suit losers, but passing
would have been a breach of discipline. So he duly bid 5C hoping
for a 6-5 or 0-3-5-5 in North. Not this time. E/W quickly cashed
their three tricks for one down: minus 50.

{
CR - In the Polish system very strong hands are opened with 1C.
So the 3C bid was somewhat limited. Jassem judged that bidding
on would result in a minus score most of the time, so he decided
not to push for the nonvulnerable game bonus. This proved to
be the right decision, although Tuszynski took twelve tricks
after a trump lead. Plus 170 for N/S and 6 IMPs to Poland, 61-81.5.
Too little, too late.

{
OR - Duboin's possibly short club attracted a 1S overcall, and
a 2S raise. He doubled to show a non-minimum, and Bocchi bid
2NT. It's unclear whether this was meant as natural, or a weak
lebenstention scramble. Duboin bid 3C, which suggests he took
it as a scramble, and Bocchi bid 3NT, which suggests he was bidding
naturally [DC]. The S4 was won by the SK, and the D5 went to
the nine, and king. The S7 switch rode to the jack, and ace.
When the DJ lost to the DQ, West cashed the SQ (declarer discarded
the HJ - instead of the C2!): minus 300.

{
CR - Jassem's 1D was 12-18 HCP, and at least four diamonds. When
the spade overcall came back to him, he doubled, and the partnership
settled in a relatively safe partscore. Declarer won the S4 lead
with the singleton SK, and felled the onside CK at trick two.
This gave him entries to hand for the double diamond finesse.
When the diamond honors were split, declarer had a ninth trick:
plus 150. That was 10 IMPs to Poland on the last board of the
match (when it could have been 10 the other way). Italy held
on to win, 81.5-71.
