{
OR - The Italians use a 9-12 HCP 1NT opening in 1st or 2nd position
non-vulnerable, and Duboin's 2H was a transfer, showing 5+ spades.
When Manoppo doubled showing good hearts, Bocchi redoubled to
show a maximum with a spade fit. Lasut competed with 3H, and
Duboin took a shot at 4S. Manoppo made the dangerous lead of
a low club, but luckily for him Lasut's singleton was the eight,
so it cost nothing. With Lasut's spades worth a trick, 4S went
one down quietly. +50 NS.

CR - 1D was natural with 12-17, or 12-14 balanced. When de Falco
bid 2H, Sacul couldn't show a three-card spade raise (2S would
have shown four), so he passed. 3D was a good raise to 3H, and
though de Falco was maximum in high cards, his soft values in
the minor suits turned him off. Had Karwur doubled in the pass-out
seat (take-out), EW would have gone +140, but afraid of hearing
4D, he bid 4C instead - and was left to play there. After a successful
spade finesse Karwur played clubs from the top and finished two
down. +100 NS; 2 Italian IMPs.

and the rest of the auction was natural. 2H was a sensible contract.
Declarer played in straightforward fashion, throwing a diamond
on the third round of clubs in order to maintain trump control
if hearts broke 4-2. Thus he held himself to eight tricks, +110

Bocchi couldn't bid 2C, as that showed a transfer advance with
five plus diamonds and nine plus points. Bocchi had the transfer
advance he couldn't use, and Lasut wasn't playing transfer advances,
so he couldn't bid 2D to show his hearts. The CJ held the first
trick, and declarer ruffed the continuation to play ace and a
diamond. West won and played a spade, which was taken by the
SA. The S6 held up nicely for the diamond ruff, and declarer
had 7 tricks. Plus 80.

CR - On a similar auction, Karwur re-opened with 2D over 1S.
An aggressive stance to be sure. DeFalco doubled this (typically
a 6313 type), and when Ferraro bid 2H, and 3H over Sacul's 3C
bid, DeFalco reconsidered and gave game a shot. The DK was taken
by dummy's ace, and declarer played the C10,J,K,A. The DQ was
cashed, and a club was ruffed on dummy. Declarer ruffed a diamond
to hand and took the losing spade finesse. The CQ forced the
HQ, promoting a trump trick in the West hand, and declarer was
down one. Plus 50, and 4 IMPs to Indonesia.

OR - Duboin's 2D was either a weak two-bid in a major, or 20-22
balanced. 2S was to play opposite the weak spade hand, and when
Duboin showed the strong variety, Bocchi showed his heart suit
with a transfer bid. Over 3H, it looks normal to bid 3NT and
let West choose between 3NT and 4H, but Bocchi bid 4H instead,
expecting his good suit to be playable even on a 5-2 fit. On
a bad day, it would have failed (when 3NT makes), but with the
SK onside and hearts 4-2, 4H made with an overtrick. +650 EW.

{
OR - Playing a strong club and five-card majors, North opened
a catch-all 1D. Bocchi got active when he threw in a non-vulnerable
overcall on his 'solid' four-card suit. This enabled Duboin to
crowd the auction with a preemptive 3S raise. Lasut-Manoppo coped
incredibly well with this interference. North found a remarkable
raise, bypassing 3NT, and South judged well not to bid 5C because
of his lack of aces. 4C was the last contract NS could make.
An excellent +130 to NS.

not hard pressed to find the killing spade queen lead. The defense
took three spades and two aces for one down. +100 to EW, 6 IMPs

defence, and saved in 5D. Duboin doubled to slow the auction
down, and Bocchi led the D7. Declarer had no way of avoiding
the loss of two spades and two hearts. He was down two, plus

a pre-save 5D. Karwur applied the hammer, not willing to have
anything to do with the five-level. The CK lead only delayed
the inevitable loss of four tricks for declarer. He was down
two, for the same minus 300 as his counter-part; no swing. The

OR - The fate of 4S depended on declarers ability to find the
queen of trumps. This was difficult, since we've all learned
that you have to play for the drop with nine cards combined.
However, Manoppo had a couple of clues. First of all East had
shown up with AK of clubs and the ace of hearts. With short spades
he might have doubled one spade. Furthermore East played another
heart at trick four despite a discouraging signal from West.
Why not a third round of clubs? Because he was protecting his
queen of spades! +50 to EW.

{
OR - At this position and vulnerability, Bocchi's 1NT showed
12-14 HCP. When that was passed around to Manoppo, he had a penalty
double available, but must have considered his hand too weak
for it, since he passed. On Lasut's heart lead, the lack of entries
to dummy made it conveniant for Bocchi to play Lasut for short
diamonds, but when the cards failed to cooperate, he could only
take five tricks (2H, 2D and the CA). +200 NS.

{
CR - At this table, Sacul's 1NT rebid showed 12-14 HCP but didn't
promise real diamonds, so Karwur couldn't take out to 2D (which
plays at least one trick better than 1NT). After a heart lead
to the ace and a low diamond to the jack and king, de Falco didn't
return a heart but shifted to the CJ, covered all around. Two
rounds of diamond put Ferraro on lead, and when he returned the
SJ, the defense got the same eight tricks as at the other table,
but in a different way. +200 NS. No swing.

{
OR - Duboin didn't have the stomach to sit for his mini notrump
when it got doubled, so he ran to his long suit. Manoppo took
quite a position when he whacked this on a three-card suit in
direct position, the more normal approach being to let partner
decide. Duboin bought a wonderful dummy and couldn't be prevented
from taking eight tricks (4D, 1H, 1S and 2 club ruffs). +180
to Italy.

{
CR - At this table the Italians tried to make their opponents
life miserable with another pet toy. 2C showed a weak hand with
both majors. North gave preference and bought it in 2S. Usually
the best lead against this type of sequence is a trump, but Sacul
preferred a diamond. After some choppy play declarer emerged
with eight tricks. +110 and a 7 imp swing to Italy.

{
OR - Duboin's re-opening double caught Bocchi with a grand collection.
He chose 2C, and when this went back to Manoppo, he bid 2D. Duboin's
double in the passout seat showed the strong notrump type, and
Bocchi left it in. Lasut ran to his unappetizing four-card heart
suit. The S7 was led, and declarer won the ace to play the C2
to West's ten. Duboin replied with HA and a heart (fearing club
ruff). In again with the DA, West had to allow declarer to cash
the DK and SQ. When he ruffed a diamond with the H10 - he was
done. End-played! A fine plus 110.

{
CR - Karwur's 15-17 HCP notrump was greeted by a single-suited
double from DeFalco. 2C was asking, 2D was showing. Karwur's
balancing double was left in for penalties by Sacul (who really
had nowhere to go). The C4 was led to Karwur's queen, and he
tried the HA, followed by the H3. Declarer played to his SK,
and led a trump to Karwur's ace. Karwur gave Sacul a heart ruff,
but the defence only had one more trump coming. A glorious plus
180, but only 2 IMPS to Italy who were ahead at the half; 18-12.
