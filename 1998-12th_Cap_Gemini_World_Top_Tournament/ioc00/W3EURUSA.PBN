OR - Welcome to the Dutch ladies sitting NS in this 3rd set.
They let their presence be felt right away by a fairly agressive
balancing action (remember, North was a passed hand, too, and
there was no guarantee of a fit), while 1NT might go down, depending
on how declarer would tackle the diamonds. However, 2C was a
pianola after the defense opened up the diamonds, South taking
3 tricks in clubs, 3 in diamonds, and 2 in hearts, for plus 90

CR - The newcomers at this table were the Americans Breed and
Quinn. Breed, North, doubled West's 1NT overcall after South
had opened a poor hand in 3rd seat. Declarer should have gone
down after misguessing the diamonds if the defense shifts to
clubs, but as so often happens, these contracts are difficult
to defend. Eventually, West took 2 hearts, 2 spades, 2 clubs,
and 1 diamond before the defenders had developed 7 tricks of
their own. plus 180 to EW and 7 imps to Europe.

rebid 2C to end up in 2D. However, 2D is very likely to go 1
down. On the other hand, 2H by South will usually make - unless
West gets to ruff a spade with a low trump and scores the heart
Queen as well. Plus 100 to NS.

2 hearts, 1 club, and 1 spade to go only 1 down. Apparently West,
Malinowsky, had little compunction about rebidding 1NT on her
very light semi-balanced hand, and understandably, East gave
one more push - overboard, as it happens. The gain in the play
netted 50 points or 2 imps to Europe.

the take-out double into a penalty double (indeed, it takes North's
spade Jack and Nine to make that action succeed). After a spade
lead for dummy's nine, South played another spade, taken by West.
The club shift was successful, and finding the diamonds favorably

immediate success, the trick came right back when East shifted
to a club. South now knocked out the heart Ace, let East hold
the club return, and knew what to do after the diamond shift.

[Declarer "E"]
{
OR - The auction quickly fizzled out after reaching the 3-level.
Declarer in 3H has 3 side suit losers, and her treatment of the
trump suit seems a cross between a safety play and the principle
of restricted choice. However, once the heart King fetches South's
Jack, there is little point in leading the heart 10 next. North
would cover with Q87 and get a heart trick anyway. Continuing
with the 2 to the Ace would pick up QJ-doubleton, and leave the
10 and 9 intact to knock out the Jack in case of a 4-1 break.
Plus 140 to EW.

[Declarer "S"]
{
CR - Having a substantial lead in the match may have contributed
to West's decision not to make a take-out double on a somewhat
flawed holding (min. HCP, 3 hearts only). The question is: how
should South play the clubs for only 1 loser. On the bidding,
East was unlikely to hold 3 Aces and West (with 2 spades only)
as many as 13 HCP: heart King , diamond KQ (lead), club Ace (inference)
and Jack. The distribution also points to the actual layout.
Thus, playing East to hold CJ-doubleton has a lot going for it.
But no: 1 down for minus 100 and only 1 rather than 6 imps.

or 3 key cards), 5H inquired about the Queen of trumps (and possibly
extra length). When there appeared to be a possible trump loser,
North signed off in 6S. Declarer won the trump lead and cleared
the suit. When the diamonds behaved no club finesse was required.
+1430 to NS.

{
CR - In essence, the auction was identical to the one in the
open room. The play must have been the same as well, and the
board yielded no swing. Notice that if West rather than East
held the defensive trump trick, declarer must test diamonds rather
than surrender the lead in trumps. That way, she knows whether
she needs the club finesse if East were to return a club after
winning the spade trick, no swing.

{
OR - The auction presented a strategic problem. Knowing that
South in the other room was likely to bid a game given the state
of the match, this South, holding prime cards (aces and a king)
plus a ruffing value, should probably carry on to game anyway,
in order to avoid a swing. When, after a cross-ruff, declarer
managed to avoid losing 2 trump tricks in the endgame, she scored
an overtrick for 170 to EW.

{
CR - As predicted, the closed room South did carry on to game.
If you follow the play, you'll see that declarer was lucky to
have a loser-on-loser play at trick 9 (leading the fourth round
of spades and pitching a diamond from dummy) so that East won
the trick. As East did not have a third trump to return, declarer
managed to make her last 4 trumps separately by cross-ruffing,
and scrambled home. This situation could have been avoided by
more judicious timing. Plus 420 to NS and 6 imps to North America.

OR - Holding a Queen in the wrong rounded suit meant that West

game contract was distinctly poor, but having some catching up
to do, one has to try something; plus 50 to NS.

{
CR - In this room, South advanced with 2H over her partner's
1S overcall. This froze out West temporarily, but she could introduce
her second suit after partner's competitive double. However,
when NS pressed on to 3H, West declined to complete bidding her
pattern with her minimum hand and a useless heart Q. East, having
good prime cards, but no guaranty of a good fit, preferred to
defend. EW cashed their 5 top tricks, and South couldn't go wrong.
One down, plus 100 to EW and 4 imps to Europe. Net result of
the set: 1 imp to Europe.
