{
OR - 2C showed 11-15 and either 5 clubs and a 4-card major, or
6+ clubs. A take-out double should deliver strength or distribution,
or both, but Ferraro had neither. The Italians were heading for
minus 200 or more, until Manoppo came to their rescue with a
strange 3C rebid, taking them off the hook. It looks like declarer
has five losers, but when Manoppo played Ferraro for four spades
and the DK, he could execute an endplay, for a well played nine
tricks. Plus 110. [AW]

{
CR - Versace had a 2C relay available after 1S, so 2D was natural
and weak, but Lauria had good enough clubs to go to the three-level.
Sacul led a diamond, giving declarer his second diamond trick
immediately. When Lauria later played to the SQ, Karwur could
have given declarer a problem by ducking. And if Lauria falls
for it and leads to the S10, down he goes. Now he had his nine
tricks: plus 110, and no swing. Indonesia carried forward a 1-IMP
advantage, which we'll include in the scores the rest of the
way.

break scuttles 6D, though declarer is only one entry short of
nice trump coup. Manoppo found the best opening lead - the C2
- ten, jack, king. The DK held, and Ferraro crossed to the SA
to lead the DQ. South pitched a spade on this trick, so declarer
had nine tricks without having to guess spades (four spades,
one heart, two diamonds and two clubs). Plus 400.

{
CR - The identical auction was perpetrated in this room. Lauria
also found the lead of the C2. Here, however, Versace clung to
his three small spades. When the moment of truth came, declarer
backed his judgment that the spades were likely four-two from
the discarding (South had thrown 2-9 of hearts and followed 6-8-7
of spades). Karwur finished two down two when the defenders took
one spade, two diamonds and three clubs (Lauria, like Manoppo,
had continued with the CQ when he won the DA): plus 100. 11 IMPs
to to Italy, ahead 11-1.

{
OR - Manoppo's 1D opening was a catchall bid with 11-15 HCP,
and Lasut's 3D was preemptive. When the Italians sailed into
4H, Lasut looked at the vulnerability and saved in 5D. Manoppo
cleverly ducked de Falco's HK opening lead, hoping for another
heart, but Italians use odd-even signals, so Ferraro's H2 was
discouraging (as it was even) and suggested a club shift (as
it was low). DeFalco played back a low club, but Ferraro didn't
have the CA doubleton, so Manoppo only lost the obvious five
tricks. Three down: minus 500.

CR - Here, 1D showed real diamonds, so Lauria had no reason to
bid 4D over 3H, and E/W were left to play 4H. Versace led a diamond,
and Lauria returned a club: jack, queen, ace. A trump to the
king, SK to the ace, a second club to the king, and the DK for
a club pitch. Then Sacul had to guess whether Versace had one
heart and no clubs or the opposite. In the former case, he must
lead a trump, but in the latter he has to ruff a club and lead
a heart down. Sacul got it right: plus 620. 3 IMPs to Indonesia,
4-11.

{
OR - After a normal start of the auction West took an extremely
agressive view to rebid 2NT. East's raise to 3NT was based on
his "solid" spade suit. After the  lead of the HJ, covered all
around, Ferraro was prepared to cash out for two down. The bad
spade break made things a lot worse, and he finished minus 250.
On a positive note, E/W were not vulnerable.

CR - Here West made a normal pass on 2S. North backed in with
a balancing 2NT, showing an unspecified two-suiter. After 3D,
it was clear that he held diamonds and hearts. With four very
valuable cards (HK, DK and CAK) South did his hand justice by
jumping to 4H. West doubled, only to find out he couldn't beat
the contract. Declarer fooled around for a while, but took the
trump finesse for his contract in the end. His luck was in and
he scored plus 590 for an unusual 8 IMP swing. Italy, 19-4.

OR - DeFalco opened a 14-16 HCP notrump and found that thereafter
he wasn't invited to the party. Ferraro decided to bid game without
inviting on his nine-count. This seems a tad aggressive, not
vulnerable [DC]. The poor 23-point game had little chance of
success without any source of tricks. Lasut led the C2 to  the
jack and ace. The DK held, but the D9 lost to the jack. When
the smoke had cleared, declarer had only seven tricks (one spade,
one heart, two diamonds and three clubs). Down two: minus 100.

was natural, and well within itself. The Indonesians stopped
at a comfortable level in this room. The D5 ran around to declarer's
nine, and the H5 went to the queen, and ace. The diamond return
was ducked to dummy's blank king, and Versace covered the H9,

OR - 2C was natural and limited, but was quickly brushed aside
by E/W. DeFalco had only had 10 HCP for his jump to 3NT, but
on a club lead, Ferraro would need only six diamonds to the ace
and an outside ace for 3NT to succeed. Here he had only five
diamonds and no outside ace, but he had a second club stopper
and extra strength, so after knocking out the SA, there were
ten tricks for the taking: plus 630.

win the trick with the ten, so he went up ace and led back a

OR - The defense was the thing on this board. East started with
the HA, then continued low. North ruffed and played three rounds
of trumps, East discarding deuce-four of hearts. On lead with
the SQ, Ferraro faced a tough problem. On the actual layout any
club shift beats 4S as declarer can lead towards his diamond
honors only once. However, give North one diamond less and one
club more and Ferraro's ace of diamonds would have been a winner.
A count discard in clubs from De Falco would have been very helpful.
Plus 620. Very tough indeed.

hoping to defeat 1S. On a diamond lead (why not one of those
magnificent trumps?) and club return, DeFalco did the right thing
by putting in the C10, but with spades five-two, he still had
to lose seven tricks. One down: minus 200.

{
CR - Italy wanted to play spades at this table too, and here
they took an incredible nine tricks! Lauria's 2C rebid was either
minimum with 4+ clubs or any strong hand, and 2S showed a bad
hand. Most lines of defense lead to one down, but on a trump
lead combined with some less-than-memorable discarding, Lauria
managed an endplay against Karwur that produced two club winners
for declarer. Three made: plus 140. 2 IMPs to Indonesia, 12-26.

{
OR - 7H is an excellent contract, only failing when North has
four or five hearts to the jack. Ferraro-De Falco duly got there.
Playing a strong club system, West felt free to jump to 3D at
his second turn. East set trumps with 3H and E/W started cue-bidding,
the redouble of 4C showing first-round control, obviously a void
from East's point of view. DeFalco used RKCB and bid 7H when
he found out that all key cards and the HQ were on board. He
knew his partner was 3-5-5-0 and that the two spade losers would
go on the ace-king of clubs. Plus 2210.

{
CR - Playing two-over-one game force Sacul-Karwur were able to
set trumps at a very low level (2H). 3C showed shortness and
a series of cue bids followed. After 5C West knew his partner
had the ace-king of clubs (two spade discards) and the ace of
diamonds. With a grand slam force 5NT he asked for top honours
in hearts. East showed his ace and the grand slam was reached
again. The DQ was a huge bonus. Plus 2210. No swing.

OR - A strange one indeed. Manoppo left in Lasut's takeout double
with his three jacks, and DeFalco decided to sit it out with
his opening bid. He was quite sure he could scramble seven or
more tricks, as his S10 rated to be a big card. Lasut led the
H5 and DeFalco won to lead a club to the ten and queen. Lasut
persisted with hearts, holding declarer to three spades, three
hearts and one diamond. Making one: plus 160. It's interesting
to speculate about why DeFalco did not redouble. [DC]
