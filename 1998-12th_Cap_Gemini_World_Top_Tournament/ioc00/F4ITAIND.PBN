{
OR - When Versace opened with a light 1C in 3rd chair, Manoppo
could have overcalled with 1NT, 15-18, but preferred 1H on a
so-so four-card suit instead. That led to North's declaring 1NT,
a contract that goes one down on a low diamond lead. Lasut preferred
to lead his partner's suit, of course, and Lauria put up the
queen, won by the ace. If Manoppo switches to the DJ, the defense
can establish two diamond tricks in time for one down, but when
he played another heart, Lauria was ahead in the race. Just made:
plus 90.

CR - Duboin's 1C was either natural, or (here) 13-16 balanced,
or any game force; 1H showed four or more spades; and 1NT showed
the balanced hand too strong for a 9-12 notrump. Duboin got a
heart lead, took Karwur's queen with the ace, and misguessed
diamonds, leading low to the queen. A spade switch now would
put the defenders ahead in the quest for seven tricks, but as
Karwur didn't know how many hearts Sacul had, he returned his
partner's suit and lost a crucial tempo. Just made: plus 90 and
5 IMPs to Italy, 62-79.

not willing to venture a double in the pass-out seat. After a
heart lead to dummy's queen, declarer developed the fourth diamond.
On lead with the DJ, Sacul shifted to spades instead of returning
partner's suit. This proved to be fatal, as declarer took the
third spade and played a club. With the defenders' communications
cut, North was forced to concede a club trick to dummy sooner
or later. Sacul chose "sooner" as he cashed the ace of clubs
before returning his heart. Plus 90, and   5 IMPs to Italy, 67-79.

set a trap for his opponents, but they had located an eight-card
fit and Versace's hand was not well-suited for defense. Besides,
Lauria's doubles were both for takeout. Versace suggested two
places to play with his 2NT scramble and the nine-card club fit
played comfortably for ten tricks: plus 130. When dummy's HJ

did well to resist the temptation to convert it (right: 2H is
cold), and when the CQ won the first trick, it looked as if 3NT
was due to make. Manoppo found a pretty defense, however, making
Lauria pay for not leading the HK from hand while he retained
the SJ as an entry. Lauria couldn't untangle his tricks and finished
one down: minus 100. Lauria also missed a chance by ducking the
second club, depriving himself of the exit card to endplay Lasut
to force a heart return). [AW]

fun to play, but it wasn't doubled and the opponents figured
to make something, so when Duboin managed six tricks after the
HK lead he couldn't be too disappointed. Indeed, had Manoppo
been less inspired and Lauria more so at the other table, Duboin's
minus 200 would have won the board handily. 7 IMPs to Manoppo

OR - A light takeout double from Manoppo and a full-blooded jump
to game by Lasut got the Indonesians to an unlikely 4H. Thanks
to the magnificent trump position, the thin game is a lucky make.
However, Lauria-Versace hardly deserved a plus score. South led
a club to the king and North returned the C10 as a suit preference
card for South to ruff. Unfortunately for Italy, this thoughtful
play set up the C8 for a spade discard. Lasut sagely got trumps
right, because North would have covered the H10 with J875 ensure
a trump trick. Plus 450. [BW]

{
CR - Duboin chose an unfortunate moment to adopt a conservative
approach, passing up not only the aggressive direct takeout double
but also the normal-looking reopening double in the opponents'
"fit" auction. Karwur had a chance to make 2S. After drawing
trumps and eliminating the red suits he had to guess the clubs
in the ending. Since West had shown up with the HA and the king-queen
of diamonds, declarer was entitled to place the CA with East.
A club to the king would endplay Bocchi if he had the jack as
well. However, Karwur chose to play for split honors and led
the queen from hand. To his surprise it was West who won the
ace. When a club came back, declarer finessed for one down. Still,
that was an 8-IMP gain for Indonesia, 27 IMPs ahead, 94-67.

was reached easily. Manoppo didn't entertain any serious thoughts
of trying for a penalty of 1S. After all, the defence probably
has to be double dummy to defeat 1S four tricks. East must win
a red card, and immediately shift to a trump. With the cards
lying extremely well for E/W, Lasut had no problem taking twelve
tricks: plus 680. Would the Italians find the lucky slam at the

doubled! On the bidding, partner could hold at most, a five-count,
so this was a very bad time to get involved [DC]. A business
redouble from Duboin ended it. The C2 scored North's queen at

{
CR - Not surprisingly, the auction was identical to that in the
Open Room. Here, though, the lead was the S7. When declarer dislodged
the DA, Karwur found the heart shift. When declarer ducked this,
and won the next, he had to decide whether South was squeezed
out of the CQ. He played with the odds and finessed, and lost
to the blank CQ. Nine tricks: plus 600. 1 IMP to Indonesia, now
ahead by 17 IMPs, 100-83.

{
OR - Lauria picked up his strongest hand of the tournament (so
far!) and opened 2C, strong, artificial and forcing. Versace's
2D was either a relay or 5+ hearts, and his jump to 4S showed
four-card support but no outside controls (fast arrival). Lauria
wasn't to be stopped, however, and jumped to 5NT, trump ask,
prepared to be in 7S opposite queen-fourth of spades, and out.
6C denied the queen, so Lauria settled for 6S. Spades were 3-1,
but diamonds broke, so Lauria didn't need the club finesse: plus
1430.

[Declarer "S"]
{
CR - The vagaries of Sacul-Karwur's artificial methods resulted
in the weak hand declaring 6S, which could have been a disaster
on a club lead with bad luck in both black suits. 1C was 16+,
1D 0-7, 1H an artificial force, and 1S a further negative. Here,
too, North used the grand slam force (5NT) to learn whether South
had the SQ, settling for 6C when he didn't. Plus 1430; no swing.

his way to ten tricks, taking ruffs everywhere and waiting for
the defenders to play trumps or allow him an extra ruffing trick:
plus 170.

CR - The auction was exactly the same as in the Open Room. In
the play, Karwur chose to draw trumps, a slightly inferior line
at first glance. With no bad breaks he made nine tricks easily:
two spades, two clubs, a diamond and four trumps: plus 140. 1
IMP to Italy, 84-100.

{
OR - The 2C bid is not clearly defined in the Lasut-Manoppo notes,
but looks like a version of old-fashioned Drury, which did not
promise a fit. Otherwise, it appears to the naked eye that they
explored their two 5-3 fits before coming to rest in the 5-2
fit. With the foul spade break, either 5-3 minor fit would have
fared better than 2S. N/S can make 2H, but have no convenient
way to compete. Versace's S7 was an inspired choice. Although
Lasut found the DQ, the defense was in control. Lasut lost three
spades, two hearts and one club for down one: minus 50.

{
CR - Both 5-3 minor-suit fits were lost here as well. Bocchi
passed Duboin's non-forcing 1NT (2C or 2D would be artificial),
and the defence started the H7. Mirabile dictu! The suit was
now blocked. N/S could run only four of their six heart tricks!
Declarer would have had to guess the DQ for his contract if the
defenders had taken their six hearts. He had no trouble guessing
it here! Making two: plus 120. A 5-IMP swing to Italy, who won
the penultimate stanza 32-21 and now trailed by only 11 IMPs,
89-100. Only twelve boards remained in the 2000 IOC Grand Prix.
