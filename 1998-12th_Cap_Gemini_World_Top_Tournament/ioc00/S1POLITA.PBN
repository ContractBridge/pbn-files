{
OR - With 9 HCP, some useful intermediates and a five-card suit,
nobody raises 1NT (15-17) one step only. Not Versace, anyway.
Lauria had a hand with which he would have passed an invitational
2NT, but even with this mis-fitting minimum, 3NT was a respectable
contract. With hearts coming in, Lauria would have made his game
had the SK been onside. When it wasn't, after Tuszynski's good
diamond lead, Lauria was going down, and he knew it: minus 50.

When the spade finesse failed and South continued diamonds, declarer
(Pszczola) cashed out for one down: minus 50. No swing. Italy
carried forward 1.5 IMPs from the round robin, so if you're keeping
score, Italy starts with a small lead.

the way to develop most strong hands. 2D would have been artificial
and 2S described Versace's hand well. As Lauria would have passed
with the limited hand, 3S showed the strong type. The auction
does look natural, doesn't it? Versace was not hard pressed to
take ten tricks. He might have tried for an overtrick by sneaking
the ten of diamonds past North, but that would have sunk the
contract if the DK were singleton. Plus 420.

some strong two-suiters without a diamond stopper, but West's
shape strongly suggested a suit contract. Kwiecien, in contrast
to Versace, did by not draw a second round of trumps, which might
have enabled him to ruff a diamond in dummy in certain variations.
Plus 420 here too. No swing.

OR - Jassem sensibly upgraded his 14 HCP to a strong notrump
because of his intermediates and five-card suit. Lauria led the
S4 to the ten and king. Versace allowed the DJ to hold and declarer
unblocked clubs, crossed to the SA, and got the bad news on the
CA. When he reverted to diamonds, Versace ducked the D10 as well
(a commentator's delight)! Jassem fell for the ruse and played
the D7 to the queen (if he had been carefully watching Lauria's
diamond spots - he would surely have chuckled, and dropped the
DK). Down two: minus 100. [DC]

side, West had a natural heart lead. The defenders ran their
five heart tricks, and Kwiecien exited the S10. Declarer tried

{
OR - Although many pairs playing five-card majors treat a 1NT
response as forcing for one round, or at least semi-forcing,
the Poles don't. That meant Tuszynski didn't have to find a rebid
on his "unbiddable" hand, which was too weak for 2S and too short
for 2H or two-of-a-minor. 1NT was a decent contract, and with
all suits breaking Jassem had no problems making it. Versace
switched to a low diamond after winning the HJ, playing Lauria
for the DJ, but losing an overtrick when Jassem had it. Making
two: plus 120.

CR - 1S was a relay (like a forcing notrump), denying five+ spades.
1NT showed a minimum with four spades (as here) or 3-5-2-3 distribution.
Bocchi knew where to play. When the lead of the DQ revealed that
West held  the king-queen, Duboin ducked, took the D3 continuation
with the jack, and ran the H10. Kwiecien drove out the DA, and
Duboin tested spades first, carefully winning the third trick
in dummy. When the suit split, he did not need the heart finesse
for his contract so he led to the HA and cashed his long spade.
Making one: plus 90, but 1 IMP to Poland.

OR - A decent slam for E/W, basically needing normal breaks in
hearts and clubs. Lauria-Versace had a smooth sequence. West
used the fourth suit to set up a game force. East's 3C bid, showing
concentrated strength in that suit, was just what the doctor
ordered. After a trump lead Versace drew only one more round,
preparing to ruff the C10 in dummy. With the jack dropping that
was not necessary. In the ending North got squeezed for the overtrick:
plus 1010.

CR - Kwiecien-Pszczola bid less scientifically than their Italian
counterparts. 1C was a one-round force, but much more natural
than the various "Polish" versions (1D would have promised five
or 4-4-4-1) and 2C was the equivalent of "fourth suit forcing."
When East admitted to some heart support West simply blasted
the slam. In the play declarer lost his overtrick when he won
the diamond lead in dummy. This cut the communication lines for
a squeeze, so Kwiecien had to settle for plus 980 and a 1-IMP
loss. Italy 2.5-1

no trouble. Versace led the H2, and Lauria won the ace to switch
to the C6 to the jack and king. After a trump to the jack, and
queen, Versace continued clubs. Declarer won and led the S10
to Lauria's blank ace (a low one would not have shut out the

to die at the two-level. His 2S bid pushed Pszczola to 3H, and
there they rested. Bocchi led the S5 and declarer played ace
and king before testing trumps. When the foul break came to light,
declarer ruffed his spade loser in dummy and played a club to
the jack and king. Bocchi cashed the hig trumps and played on
diamonds, so declarer did not score a club trick. Two down: minus

{
OR - Two-suited bids with a six-card major and a five-card minor
are dangerous, because the six-two major-suit fit may prove elusive.
However, with a hand strong enough to introduce the major over
a minimum response (as here), it's fine. As 2S showed clubs and
hearts, so Lauria had enough for 4C over 3D with his four trumps
and the golden HK. 6C is a very good contract, but Tuszynski's
penalty double hinted that the reasonable breaks required would
not be forthcoming. Lauria had to go two down on a diamond lead:
 minus 500.

CR - If the bidding was optimistic in the Open Room, it was the
opposite here. Duboin thought his hand looked more like a good
weak two-bid than a 1S opening, and when the Poles had no two-suited
gadget available, Kwiecien showed his strength with a double
followed by 3H. Personally, I think king-doubleton in support
is enough for a raise, but Pszczola thought otherwise - and right
he was. Declarer lost 1 heart, 1 diamond and 2 clubs: a spectacular

It's unclear why East preferred 4C to the more obvious 3S. North

This doomed the slam. Obviously Versace expected more from partners
4C bid when he raised 5D to six. As it was, EW would have been
a lot better off just blasting the slam. South might well have

shortness, and 3NT ended the auction. Well bid, as slam requires
the clubs to come in without loss, hearts 3-3 (more or less),

{
CR - The Poles' auction looks shakier than their counterparts.
3C was a relay, but the rest of the bidding creates the impression
of uncertainty. Kwiecien tried to play in 6C (slight extra chance
here as declarer could try and ruff out the SK, and/or duck a
heart, play two trumps, and revert to hearts) but it seems that
Pszczola thought spades were in the picture. Duboin avoided the
fatal spade lead, and selected the C5. There were only eleven
tricks available now for down one: minus 100. 13 IMPs to Italy,
ahead now by half an IMP, 24-23.5 [DC]

{
OR - The Poles' convention card hints that Jassem's 3C was merely
invitational.  If this is so, then Tuszynski's 3NT strikes me
as a good piece of evaluation, with stoppers, fast tricks and
club length. Versace's opening lead was "attitude" (strong holding)
and Tuszynski had to guess who had the CA. Since Versace may
have overcalled 1H on a five- or six-card suit headed by K-10
plus the CA, I think East is more likely to have it - and that
you should duck hearts twice. Tuszynski didn't agree with me.
He won the first trick and was quickly defeated: minus 100. [AW]

{
CR - I'm glad to report that treating this East hand as a weak
2S opening (bad suit, three hearts and lots of strength outside
spades) didn't produce a good result. So is Lauria, East at the
other table, who could have opened 2S but didn't. Kwiecien pre-empted
with 3H (pass or correct), and E/W finished in 3S. On a club
lead, and with everything lying well, Pszczola was able to get
out for one down: minus 100. Double dummy, there is a second
undertrick available on a heart lead and a subsequent heart ruff.
5 IMPs to Italy, ahead 28.5-24. [AW]

{
OR - West doesn't have a classic double of 1S, but it's an action
we all would take. More interesting, perhaps, is West's rebid
after a hypothetical 2C from partner. According to a modern bidding
theory you may rebid 2D without showing extra values ("Equal
Level Conversion"). It was no issue on this board, East having
enough values to make a stronger bid. Lauria preferred a cue-bid
to a natural 2NT. Declarer ducked the first spade in case the
suit split 5-2, and then ducked a diamond to North. He took the
obvious nine tricks for plus 400.

{
CR - Bocchi-Duboin open 2H and 2S with poor weak two's and 2D
(Multi) with classical hands, which explains Duboin's mountainous
nonvulnerable two-bid. What irony that he promptly got doubled
in 2S. E/W took all their tricks in defense, including a club
ruff by West: minus 500 for declarer and 3 IMPs to Poland. Ah
well, at least Duboin judged correctly that all his side honours
were worthless! After eleven deals it was only the carryover
that separated the two teams.

Jassem showed his diamonds, Tuszynki tried 3NT. Dummy's SJ held
at trick one, and the DJ held at trick two. A second diamond
went to the king his ace, and Tuszynski took the heart finesse,
East ducking smoothly. The DK was dislodged, and Declarer rose

to build his ninth winner. He had two spades, two hearts, three
diamonds and two clubs: plus 600.

CR - Kwiecien's Multi 2D attracted a light 2H overcall, and Pszczola
got in the way with 2S. When Versace made a card-showing double,
Bocchi leapt to the heart game, suggesting that he thought more
of his hand than mere mortals might have done. The S10 went to
the ace, and West shifted to the D3, five, queen, ace. Fearing
a diamond ruff, Bocchi played HA, HJ. Pszczola won the king,
but the DK was declarer's only other loser: plus 620. Italy gained
1 IMP, and after 12 deals were in front by a nose, 29.5-27 [DC]
