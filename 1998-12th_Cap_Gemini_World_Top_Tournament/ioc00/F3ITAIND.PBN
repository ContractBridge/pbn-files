{
OR - Barring a ruff, 6D is cold and looks relatively easy to
bid. Duboin's 2NT showed diamonds, and that Bocchi relayed to
discover that he was facing a minimum game force with at least
six diamonds and shortage in hearts. Cue-bidding led to Turbo
(4NT to show an even number of key cards) and a "last train"
5C let Bocchi do the rest. On the SK lead Duboin couldn't ruff
both his spades and still enjoy the established hearts, so he
drew trumps and conceded a club; plus 1370.

{
CR - Karwur's 2D response was game-forcing, so Sacul could start
quietly, by first showing his sixth heart, then his diamond support.
And when Karwur cooperated with a 3S cue-bid, Sacul took control
with Blackwood and learned that his partner held two key-cards
(the four aces and the DK) and a void. As the void was surely
in hearts, 6D figured to be enough. Ferraro led a thoughtful
club, which might have gained his team an IMP on a different
layout: plus 1370. No swing; Indonesia, 50-44.

OR - North's overcall did nothing to disturb EW's constructive
bidding, Manoppo-Lasut reaching 3NT after a natural sequence.
Counting on some help from partner to set up the suit Bocchi
led a low diamond rather than the jack. Manoppo did the normal
thing by going up with the king, where playing small would have
delivered a fast ninth trick. Duboin's club switch worked on
declarer's communications and when Manoppo discarded two hearts
from dummy to rely on the spade finesse for his ninth trick,
he could no longer make the hand. One down: minus 50.

{
CR - Like Bocchi, Sacul chose to lead a low diamond. Since the
jack would have denied a top honour this was a particularly good
idea on the actual layout. Ferraro got the diamonds wrong, but
left himself with a second chance by keeping three hearts in
dummy on the run of the clubs. A heart towards the queen would
have brought him the contract, but without an overcall from North
that was too difficult. Ferraro led a spade instead, winning
the ace when North showed out. When he tried a low heart next
Karwur (like Duboin in a less important position)  was wide awake,
rising with the HJ to defeat the contract. Minus 50; no swing.

{
CR - The Precision one-over-one auction landed N/S in 1NT from
the North position. With 1D potentially short, Sacul really had
little choice at his second turn. The lead of the C10 was covered
by the queen, and king. When Ferraro switched to the HJ declarer
played to develop a club trick, not, not knowing hearts were
three-three. The defense attacked spades, but failed to gather
the three clubs, two spades and one diamond that would hold declarer
to his contract. They did get five tricks, however: plus 120,
1 IMP to Italy, 45-50.

OR - Bocchi and Duboin use a 9-12 HCP 1NT in 1st or 2nd hand
non-vulnerable, but the North hand looks more like a "real" opening
bid. The East hand too is worth a lot more than its point count,
and if Lasut had risked a double, something good may have happened,
like 3NT making (best defense may defeat it, but it's close)
or 2S doubled, down three. When Lasut passed, Duboin transferred
to 2S and quit and Manoppo did not reopen. Bocchi led to the
HK at trick three, after which a spade or a diamond would have
led to three down. Three rounds of hearts allowed Bocchi to scramble
six tricks: Minus 100.

CR - Sacul's Precision 1D (11-15 natural, or 12-14 balanced)
caught DeFalco with a perfect takeout double. With diamonds bid
on his left, Ferraro didn't want to risk either 2D or 3D opposite
a likely singleton or void. A card-showing double of 2H would
have been a nice treatment to have here, especially if the defenders
manage to take all their tricks. Ferraro's H5 lead was fine (the
H10 is even better) but the rest of the defense wasn't. Karwur
scrambled home with seven tricks. Only one down: minus 50. 2
IMPs to Indonesia, 52-45.

two-suiter, a questionable action with mediocre suits, three
spades, and significant defensive strength. Despite the flaws
in 2NT, it often pays to preempt against a strong club. This
time N/S were very happy to pass out 3D. South obtained a spade
ruff, but that was with a natural trump trick. Declarer lost
two diamonds, two spades and the ace of hearts, so the contract
went one down: minus 50. 5 IMPs to Indonesia, 57-45. [BW]

OR - Duboin's 1D was 11-23 HCP, and four-plus diamonds, or a
balanced 18-19,  with possibly two diamonds. His 2S rebid denoted
an unbalanced hand after Bocchi's negative double. Bocchi, hoping
the fit was right (the three small hearts augured well for this
when the opponents bid and raised them), took a shot at game.
The C5 lead was helpful for Duboin, the king losing to the ace,
and the two rounds of hearts played next were also helpful -
a club return makes it tougher. With trumps three-two and the
finesse for the CJ onside, Duboin got home without guessing the
DK: plus 620.

CR - Sacul's 1S showed at least four and DeFalco's 2NT showed
a four-card limit raise in hearts. Sacul bid an aggressive 4C
over the 3H signoff because of his three small hearts. There
was likely a fit of some sort on the auction, but Sacul must
have had some concern about the number of trumps Karwur would
produce when he converted to 4S. The H6, a strange card in the
suit, went to the king and ace and Ferraro switched to the C5
to the king and ace. DeFalco switched back to hearts, bringing
about the same position as in the Open Room. Sacul misguessed
clubs, however, to go one down, handing 12 IMPs to Italy. The
match was tied at the halfway mark at 57.

fails only with AK10x in West or AKxx in East (in which case
East made a very good play by ducking). A heart to the queen
loses if East has K10xx or A10xx (and doesn't gain with AK10x

sat for it, even though he knew trouble was lurking. The foul
club break defeated the contract two tricks: minus 500.

{
CR - Facing long clubs, Karwur, appreciating the CQ, tried 3NT
(expecting bad breaks after East's preempt). Ferraro led the
S2 and DeFalco won the ace to return the D5, ducked by declarer.
There are several ways to defeat 3NT, the easiest being to win
the DK and continue the suit to build a second diamond to go
with two hearts and the SA. Ferraro won and played a club, however,
and took the first two rounds of hearts, so Karwur had the timing
and transportation for three hearts, three clubs, two diamonds
and a spade: plus 600. 15 IMPs to Indonesia, 78-57.

OR - 1D was natural with 11-23 or a balanced 17-19. Here, it
was the latter possibility, and Bocchi hoped for a near-maximum
when he raised. When the DK held the first round of the suit,
Duboin had to decide whether East had all the diamonds or three
small, or if West was being tricky with Q-10 or A-Q-10. He went
for the former, losing to East's D10. With both black kings favorably
placed for declarer, he couldn't go wrong. Making three: plus
400.

CR - Karwur's 1NT rebid after his strong 1C (16+) and Sacul's
negative 1D response (0-7), showed 18-20 HCP, so Karwur was on
slightly firmer ground than Bocchi at the other table. Karwur
also led a low diamond after winning the king. In the ending,
West discarded his last heart on the SQ, so Karwur could finesse
in clubs without risking defeat. Plus 430: 1 IMP to Indonesia,
79-57.

{
OR - Bocchi's 1D opening might be short only with a balanced
17-19 HCP so Duboin was safe in raising as he could pass a descriptive
2NT rebid. Manoppo might have competed with a responsive double
but tried 2H instead to protect his minor suit holdings. He allowed
himself to be pushed to 3H, and would have made it had Bocchi
led the partnership suit. Instead he chose the S8, and even if
Manoppo had played on clubs immediately, he would have been beaten
even without an inspired trump shift; a second spade does just
as well. Here Manoppo led a trump at trick two to the ten, and
queen, and a diamond switch gave the defence five tricks (two
hearts, two diamonds and one club), for down one: minus 50.

{
CR - Here Karwur did not raise Sacul's less structured 1D, so
Ferraro had room for a 2D cue bid. Sacul doubled this to show
real diamonds, which spared Ferraro the ignominy of tabling his
doubleton DK in a spade contract. Granted a reprieve, Ferraro
refused to hold back, jumping to 3H to emphasize his all-round
maximum pass. The lead of HJ resolved the trump situation for
Ferraro in 3H, but Karwur was able to push a diamond through
the king for a painless one down: minus 50. No swing. Indonesia
won the third segment 29-13 and with 24 deals remaining, led
by 20 IMPs, 79-59.
