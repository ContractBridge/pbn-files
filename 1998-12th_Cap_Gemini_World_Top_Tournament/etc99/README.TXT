The bridge games in this PBN database have been played at the European
Team Championship 1999. You can view these games with the PBN Viewer,
that can be freely downloaded from the PBN homepage:

The data have been recorded by Gianni Baldi's vugraph system.
They are also available at Baldi's Java BridgeRama :

Many thanks to Gianni!

A conversion program has translated all the data to the format of the
PBN 1.0 standard. Also thanks to Yvan Calame for sending me the raw
data.

If you have any questions or comments, don't hesitate to contact me.
